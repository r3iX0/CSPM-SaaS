/**
 * The risks list, holding two kinds of thing.
 *
 * A scenario is not a louder finding. It is several of them seen as one route,
 * scored from a different formula — floored at its worst member and amplified
 * for being short — so rendering it with the six weighted components of a
 * finding risk would invite the reader to check numbers that were never used.
 *
 * Both kinds share one list on purpose: a route outranking the findings inside
 * it is only visible where they are ranked together.
