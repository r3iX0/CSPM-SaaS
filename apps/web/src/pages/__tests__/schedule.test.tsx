/**
 * The automatic-scanning control.
 *
 * A security report ages the moment it is written, and until scheduling
 * existed every scan was a button press — a customer who connected Azure,
 * scanned once and got on with their week had a report describing an
 * environment that had moved on.
 *
 * What is worth testing here is not that a dropdown renders. It is that the
 * control cannot silently turn scheduling *off*, and that it says which state
 * it is in without the customer having to open the dropdown to find out.
