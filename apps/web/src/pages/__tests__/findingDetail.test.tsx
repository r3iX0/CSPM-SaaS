/**
 * What a finding is part of.
 *
 * The findings list ranks problems one at a time, which is right for triage
 * and wrong as a story: a medium misconfiguration on a host standing between
 * the internet and customer data is not a medium problem. The detail page is
 * the only place that can say so, and an empty answer must not read as an
 * all-clear — what counts as sensitive is something the customer declares.
