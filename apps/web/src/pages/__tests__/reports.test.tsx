/**
 * The reports page.
 *
 * Two things it must get right. A report is a document, so it cannot be
 * fetched as an envelope or linked to with a plain anchor — the bearer token
 * lives in memory, and a browser-initiated navigation would arrive
 * unauthenticated. And a server that simply cannot render PDFs is an operator
 * problem, not something a reader retries their way out of, so it is named.
