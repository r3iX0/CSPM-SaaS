/**
 * Movement since the previous reading.
 *
 * Four states, not two, and the distinctions are the point. The delta used to
 * be an estimate that reconstructed a prior score by adding back every fix ever
 * verified, so it could only ever be positive — and this rendered a green up
 * arrow unconditionally. Measuring it against the previous reading makes a
 * decline possible for the first time, at which point a hard-coded ↑ is a plain
 * untruth about the direction a customer's posture moved.
 *
 * "No previous scan" is kept separate from "no change" because they are
 * different facts: one is a comparison that could not be made, the other a
 * comparison that came out level.
 *
 * In its own module rather than beside `ScoreTrend`, and that is a bundling
 * decision rather than tidiness. This is a sentence and an arrow; that one
 * imports Recharts. While they shared a file, every page reaching for a delta
 * pulled the whole charting library behind it -- which is how 396 kB of chart
 * code ended up on the findings list, a page with no chart on it.
