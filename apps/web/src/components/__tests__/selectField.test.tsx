/**
 * A filter has to say what it is filtering by.
 *
 * Base UI keeps a select's options in a portal that is not mounted while the
 * control is closed, so a bare `<SelectValue />` has nothing to read a label
 * from and falls back to the raw value. Every filter in the app had this: a
 * window set to "Last 30 days" sat there reading `30`, and a severity filter
 * read `CRITICAL` — the machine's word for the thing, shown to the person.
