/**
 * How often CloudGuard reads each environment without being asked.
 *
 * It lives here rather than on the connection card, where it started, because
 * of what a reader is doing on each page. The connections page answers "can
 * CloudGuard see my cloud" — a setup question, asked once. This page answers
 * "when was my cloud last read, and when will it be read next", and a schedule
 * is the second half of that sentence: a scan history with no visible cadence
 * makes the gaps between runs look like something that happened rather than
 * something that was chosen.
 *
 * One control per connection, because the interval is a property of the grant
 * rather than of a subscription — every subscription beneath a connection is
 * read on the same clock.
