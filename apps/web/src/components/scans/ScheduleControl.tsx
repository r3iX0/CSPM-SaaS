/**
 * How often this environment is re-read.
 *
 * The values are the ones a customer actually asks for, not the range the API
 * accepts. An hourly option is technically valid and would mostly produce a
 * scan that is still running when the next is due; a free-number input invites
 * exactly that, so the choice is a short list of intervals that make sense for
 * a posture report.
 *
 * Saving is immediate rather than behind a Save button. There is one value and
 * changing it is reversible in a click, so a staging step would be ceremony
 * around a dropdown.
