/**
 * The security score, each time CloudGuard looked.
 *
 * A delta says something moved. This says whether that is a trend or a wobble,
 * which is the difference between a customer acting on it and ignoring it.
 *
 * Design notes, because three of them are rules rather than taste:
 *
 * **One series, one axis.** Open findings and attack-path counts are on a
 * completely different scale from a 0–100 score, so they are sparklines
 * elsewhere rather than a second line against a second axis. Two y-scales in
 * one frame let any two shapes be made to look correlated.
 *
 * **The line is neutral ink, not a score colour.** Every palette token in this
 * product is a *status* colour with a fixed meaning, and colouring the line by
 * the value it plots would make the hue change as the data does — so a reader
 * would take the colour for a category rather than the number already on the
 * axis. The meaning of the height instead lives in the bands behind it, which
 * are painted once and never move.
 *
 * **A fixed 0–100 axis.** Fitted to its own range, a wobble from 81 to 84
 * climbs as steeply as a recovery from 20 to 84.
