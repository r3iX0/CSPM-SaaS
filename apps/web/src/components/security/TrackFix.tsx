/**
 * The door into the remediation queue.
 *
 * `POST /remediation` has always existed and nothing in the UI called it: the
 * queue's own empty state told the reader to "assign a finding from its detail
 * page", and the detail page had no way to. So the queue could only ever be
 * empty, and the one screen that ranks work by impact against effort was
 * unreachable from the screens that produce the work.
 *
 * It sits under the recommended fix rather than beside "Rescan to verify",
 * because tracking work is a statement about who is going to do what is written
 * above it -- and because the verify row must not blur into a row where one
 * button records intent and another asks for proof. Assigning does move the
 * finding to IN_PROGRESS server-side; it does not close it, and the caption
 * says so where the button is.
