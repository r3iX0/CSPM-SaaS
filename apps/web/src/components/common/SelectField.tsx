/**
 * A select whose trigger says what was chosen.
 *
 * The bug this exists to make impossible: Base UI keeps a select's options in a
 * portal that is **not mounted while the control is closed**, so a bare
 * `<SelectValue />` has no item to read a label from and falls back to the raw
 * value. A filter set to "Last 30 days" then sits there reading `30`, and one
 * set to Critical reads `CRITICAL` — the machine's word for the thing, shown to
 * the person.
 *
 * `ScheduleControl` solved it locally by rendering from the value; every other
 * filter in the app had the same bug. Passing one list of options to both the
 * trigger and the menu also removes the other half of the problem, which is a
 * label defined twice and only updated once. An option's icon travels the same
 * way, so the trigger shows the shape of what is chosen as well as its name.
 *
 * `idleValue` marks the control as a filter: while the value differs from it,
 * a dot sits in the trigger, so a row of filters says which of them are
 * actually narrowing the list without the reader comparing every label
 * against its default.
