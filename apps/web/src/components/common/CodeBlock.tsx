 * A block of code or evidence, with the one thing anybody wants to do to it.
 *
 * Everything shown in a monospace block here exists to be run or pasted
 * somewhere else -- an az command, an ARM fragment, the raw JSON behind a
 * finding -- so selecting it by hand is the failure case, and it is the failure
 * case exactly when the content is long enough to matter.
 *
 * The button is visible rather than revealed on hover -- a hover-only
 * affordance does not exist at all on a touch screen -- and sits in its own
 * column beside the code, never over it, so a long line scrolls past nothing.
 *
 * Clipboard access can be refused outright -- an insecure origin, a browser
 * policy -- so the failure says what to do instead rather than leaving a button
 * that silently does nothing.
