 * Navigation grouped by the question each screen answers.
 *
 * The old shell was ten flat tabs in a horizontal strip, in the order the pages
 * happened to be built. Nothing in it said that findings and attack paths are
 * two readings of the same problem, or that remediation comes after triage --
 * so a new user met the product as a list of nouns rather than as a workflow.
 *
 * The groups are the product loop: *what is my posture*, *what is wrong*, *what
 * am I doing about it*, *what is CloudGuard working from*. A reader who learns
 * those four questions can find any screen without reading the labels.
