 * at a time, so "open the storage account called payroll" is otherwise a
 * navigate, a search, and a page turn. Here it is four keystrokes.
 *
 * **What it searches, and why not more.** Assets go to the API, which already
 * filters by name (`GET /assets?search=`). Rules are filtered here, out of the
 * cache the rules page has usually already filled -- the catalogue is dozens of
 * entries, not thousands, so a round trip would buy nothing. Findings are
 * absent: the endpoint has no text search, and the honest workaround is that a
 * rule opens its own findings (`/findings?rule_id=`) and an asset opens its
 * own. Faking it by filtering one loaded page would silently search a
 * hundredth of the data and report nothing found for the rest.
 *
 * **Navigation only, no mutations.** No "run a scan" entry, deliberately.
 * Everything here is one keystroke from a highlighted row, and a scan reads a
 * customer's whole environment; an action with a cost belongs behind a button
 * somebody meant to press.
 *
 * `shouldFilter={false}` because two filters disagreeing is worse than one:
 * cmdk's fuzzy scoring would re-rank -- and sometimes drop -- rows the server
 * already decided matched.
