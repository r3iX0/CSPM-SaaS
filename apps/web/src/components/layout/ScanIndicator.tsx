 * In the header because a scan takes minutes and outlives the page somebody
 * started it from. Previously the only way to know was to be on the scans page,
 * so a user who kicked one off and navigated away had no idea whether the
 * numbers in front of them were about to change.
 *
 * It is also where a minimised scan wizard lives: clicking it reopens the live
 * view of the running scan, wherever the reader is, rather than navigating
 * away from the page they were on.
 *
 * It also surfaces the one failure that used to be invisible: a scan that has
 * sat QUEUED long enough that no worker can plausibly be coming for it. That
 * shows as a warning rather than a spinner, because a spinner for a job nobody
 * is running is a lie told slowly.
