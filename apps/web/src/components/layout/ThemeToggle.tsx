 * Light, dark, or whatever the machine says.
 *
 * Three options rather than a two-state switch, because "system" is a real
 * answer and not a synonym for either: a laptop that goes dark in the evening
 * should take CloudGuard with it, and a binary toggle can only record the
 * choice made at one moment of one day.
 *
 * Worth having in a security product for an unglamorous reason -- this is a
 * console people sit in front of during an incident, often at night, and a
 * full-screen white findings table at 2am is a real cost. The severity palette
 * is re-lit for the dark surface rather than reused (`index.css`), so a
 * CRITICAL badge stays the most urgent thing on the page in both.
