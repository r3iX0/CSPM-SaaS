/**
 * The shape of what is open: what became of it, and how it lands in risk bands
 * once each finding is read against its asset.
 *
 * Two readings of one set, and each uses the form its question asks for:
 *
 * * **Status is a whole divided in four**, which is the one case a ring is
 *   genuinely good at, and the accepted-risk slice is the reason it is here:
 *   most products fold "we decided to live with it" into "not open", and this
 *   one refuses to.
 * * **Risk bands are a ranking**, so bars from a common baseline. A band is not
 *   the rule's severity -- it is what that finding means on that asset -- which
 *   is why it rarely has the severity strip's shape and why both are shown.
 *
 * The severity composition that used to sit first is gone: the severity strip
 * directly above counts the same four numbers.
