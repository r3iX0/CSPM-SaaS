/**
 * Where each framework stands, as evidence rather than as a verdict.
 *
 * Bars, because this is a ranking across frameworks and a ranking is compared
 * along a shared baseline. One neutral colour for all of them on purpose: these
 * are four measurements of the same kind, and giving each framework its own hue
 * would invite the reader to think the colours meant something about the
 * frameworks.
 *
 * The sentence under it is not decoration. A covered control means specific
 * misconfigurations were absent at the last scan; it is not a statement that a
 * requirement is met in law, and a green bar in a compliance panel is exactly
 * where that gets forgotten.
