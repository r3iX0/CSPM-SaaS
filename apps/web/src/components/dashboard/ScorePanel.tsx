 * The dashboard's anchor: where the posture stands, and which way it is going.

 * One panel rather than two cards, because they are one thought — a score
 * without its direction is a number somebody has to remember last week's value
 * to use. The score keeps the visual weight and the trend sits beside it as
 * context, which is the ranking a reader actually needs: *what* first, *since
 * when* second.
 *
 * The meter is a bar, not a gauge. A radial gauge spends a 150px square to
 * encode one fraction and reads as a speedometer; a bar encodes the same
 * fraction in a fifth of the space and leaves the digits as the loudest thing
 * on the page, which is what they should be.
