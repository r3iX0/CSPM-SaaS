/**
 * A route, drawn as a route.
 *
 * The list this replaces was numbered sentences: correct, and it made the
 * reader assemble the shape in their head. A chain with a visible spine shows
 * the two things that decide what to do about it -- how many links there are,
 * and which one is worth cutting -- before any of the text is read.
 *
 * Not a force-directed graph. A canvas of draggable nodes photographs well and
 * makes "which link do I break" harder to answer than a straight line does, and
 * this component exists to answer exactly that.
