/**
 * Whether this connection reacts to change, and the commands that make it.
 *
 * Sits under the schedule rather than replacing it, because the two answer
 * different questions. A schedule promises the environment is re-read at least
 * this often; this promises a change is *noticed*, which is the difference
 * between finding an open port on Friday's scan and finding it three minutes
 * after somebody opened it.
 *
 * The copy carries one thing the toggle cannot: turning this on wires nothing
 * up. Creating the delivery is a write in the customer's cloud -- an Event Grid
 * subscription on Azure, an SNS topic and an EventBridge rule on AWS -- and
 * CloudGuard holds no write permission anywhere, so it opens the webhook and
 * hands over the commands. A switch that looked like it had done the work would
 * leave a customer believing they were monitored when nothing was ever going to
 * arrive.
 *
 * AWS needs three commands where Azure needs one, because no AWS call points a
 * rule at an HTTPS endpoint directly. That is a difference in the copy and not
 * in the mechanism: both are generated per connection, and both carry a token
 * that works for this connection alone.
