/**
 * What CloudGuard was granted, and what it was not.
 *
 * How many grants there are is the provider's answer. Azure has two that fail
 * independently -- admin consent for Graph, and the ARM role -- and a customer
 * very often completes the first and forgets the second, which is why both get
 * a line. AWS has one, and a permanently green "Consent: granted" row beside it
 * would be describing a step that never happened.
 *
 * The last line is the one worth having. Consent and the reader role are
 * facts the customer can check in their own portal; "write permission: none, by
 * design" is the product's central claim about itself, and stating it beside
 * the grants -- rather than in a marketing paragraph -- puts it where somebody
 * auditing this screen will actually read it.
 *
 * Re-checking is a real probe, not a cache read: it posts to an endpoint that
 * re-tests the read and re-reads which role the assignment actually grants, so
 * the button asks Azure again. It had to become that. Re-checking used to
 * refetch the connection, and the only probe on that path runs while a
 * connection is still unverified -- so on a working connection the button
 * repainted the answer already on screen, including a role version nothing had
 * looked at since the row was created.
 *
 * The reader role line is the one that had to stop lying. A deployed role older
 * than the one CloudGuard needs was printed in the same green as a current one,
 * because the version was rendered and never compared -- so a customer whose
 * database and key vault checks were all reporting "not known" had a screen
 * telling them their access was fine, and nowhere in the product said
 * otherwise. Comparing it was only half: the recorded version was stamped when
 * the connection was created and never written again, so redeploying the role
 * could not change this line either. It is now read back from the actions the
 * assignment actually grants.
