/**
 * Supabase Auth bridge.
 *
 * CloudGuard's backend never authenticates anyone itself — it only verifies the
 * JWT Supabase issues (app/core/security.py::decode_token). This file is the
 * other half: it drives Supabase's hosted sign-in and mirrors the resulting
 * session into the same `auth` token store api.ts already uses, so the rest of
 * the app never has to know whether a session came from Supabase or from the
 * local dev-token route.
 *
 * Five ways in, all of them ending in the same Supabase-issued JWT: a magic
 * link, an email + password pair, a password reset, Microsoft (Entra ID) and
 * Google.
 * The backend cannot tell them apart and does not need to — it verifies the
 * token's signature and reads the user id, nothing more.
 *
 * Only active when VITE_SUPABASE_URL / VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY are set;
 * with neither, every function here throws rather than silently doing nothing.
