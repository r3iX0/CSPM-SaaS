 * Flat config, because ESLint 9 removed the `.eslintrc` format and the `--ext`
 * flag along with it.
 *
 * There was no config here at all: `npm run lint` pointed at a file that did
 * not exist, with ESLint itself absent from the dependencies and arriving only
 * as somebody else's transitive install. It failed the same way whether the
 * code was clean or not, and nothing noticed because the CI job runs types,
 * tests and build and never called it. That is the actual bug -- a lint script
 * nobody runs is a lint script that stops working -- so the CI job now runs it.
