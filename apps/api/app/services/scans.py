    as well, and both scans then write findings for the same resources: the
    later commit decides which one was right, and the unique index on
    (organization, rule, resource) turns the overlap into an IntegrityError
    reported to the customer as a scan that failed for no stated reason.

    A transaction-scoped advisory lock closes it. It is held until the request's
    transaction ends, which is exactly the window the check-then-insert spans,
    and it costs nothing when uncontended. Keyed on the target rather than the
    organization, so two different connections in one tenant still start
    concurrently.

    ``hashtextextended`` rather than Python's ``hash``: the value has to be the
    same in every process, and PYTHONHASHSEED makes Python's is not.

    **One key per target, whichever way the caller names it.** The key used to
    be built from both ids, and the callers do not agree on how many they hold:
    the API and the rescan button pass a connection *and* the subscription they
    resolved it from, while the scheduler, the change trigger and the
    verification sweep pass the connection alone. Two names for the same target
    are two different locks, so a customer pressing "Scan now" at the moment the
    scheduler started the same connection took one lock each, both read
    "nothing running" -- ``scan_in_flight`` matches either form and would have
    caught it -- and both inserted. The two scans then wrote findings for the
    same resources, and the unique index on (organization, rule, resource)
    turned the overlap into a scan that failed with nothing a customer could
    read.

    So the connection is the target whenever there is one, and the subscription
    only for an account that predates connections. That is exactly the set
    ``scan_in_flight`` treats as overlapping, which is what makes the check and
    the lock agree.
