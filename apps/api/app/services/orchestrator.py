"""The scan state machine: what may run now, who is running it, what is left.

A scan was one Celery task that had to survive every subscription it covered.
Here it is a set of durable steps that a worker claims, runs and settles one at
a time -- so a redeploy costs the step in flight rather than the whole scan, a
tenant of fifty subscriptions is fifty retryable units, and one unreadable
subscription no longer takes the other forty-nine with it.

Three things live here and nothing else does. What is *runnable* -- a question
about dependencies. What is *claimed* -- the concurrency control. And what a
scan's steps *add up to* -- whether it has finished, and how it finished. The
work each step performs lives in the pipeline; this module never touches Azure,
a rule or a finding.

**Why not Celery Canvas, or Temporal.** Canvas holds chord state in the Redis
result backend, which is not durable and whose semantics are all-or-nothing --
the opposite of a scan, where a subscription that could not be read is a gap in
the report rather than a reason to withhold it. Temporal supplies everything
below and costs a cluster to run plus a second source of truth for workflow
state, outside the database whose row-level security is the tenant boundary.
For a pipeline with three stages, PostgreSQL is the smaller correct answer.
