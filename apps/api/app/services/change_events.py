"""Reacting to a change in the customer's environment, without reacting to each one.

A schedule promises how stale the picture may get. It does not promise the
picture is right: a subscription read nightly is wrong from the moment somebody
opens a security group at nine in the morning until the scan at three the next.

A provider will say when something changed -- Azure through an Event Grid
subscription on the customer's own subscription. What that looks like is the
provider's business and lives beside its connector; what lives here is the part
that is the same whichever cloud it is. Three things have to be true for any of
it to be worth having, and each is a decision here rather than a detail.

**CloudGuard cannot create the subscription.** Creating one is a write in the
customer's tenant, and holding no write permission at all is the strongest
security claim this product makes. So the customer creates it, from a command
CloudGuard generates -- the same shape as the scanner role deployment, and for
the same reason.

**Most events are not about security.** A cloud reports every write, including
the ones a deployment makes to things no rule judges. An event that cannot
change a verdict must not cost a scan -- and deciding which those are needs that
cloud's own vocabulary, so it is asked of the provider rather than answered
here.

**One deployment is one change, not forty.** A template deployment emits dozens
of events in a minute. Scanning on each would turn a helpful signal into a
denial of service against the customer's own API limits -- so a burst marks the
connection and the scan waits for quiet.
