"""Deciding what a scan collects, before it collects it.

Two questions, answered in that order.

**What does anything need?** The union of every enabled rule's
``requires_evidence``, plus the connector's ``baseline_evidence`` -- the
inventory and graph listings no rule judges but the product is built from. That
union is the requirement, and it is derived rather than written down, so a rule
added with a new dependency starts being collected for and the last rule to read
a listing taking it with it when it goes.

**What do we already hold?** Evidence carries provenance and a content hash, so
a complete reading from an earlier scan can be carried into this one instead of
being taken again. Almost none of it should be, and :attr:`EvidenceKey
.reuse_window` is where that judgement lives -- per key, off by default, granted
only where a stale reading cannot change a verdict. This module asks the
question; it does not decide the policy.

What comes out is a :class:`CollectionPlan`, which the provider's plan is
filtered through. Both halves are conservative in the same direction: an
unanswerable question -- a key with no window, a blob that retention has
already pruned, an evidence row that is anything other than COMPLETE -- means
read it again. Collecting something twice costs a request; concluding from
evidence that was not there costs the only thing this product sells.
