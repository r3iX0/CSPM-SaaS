"""Connecting a customer's cloud, at a scope they choose.

The flow has two customer actions on Azure and one on AWS, and this module
knows about neither. It holds what is the same in every cloud -- creating the
connection, polling until the grant proves itself, writing the accounts
discovered beneath it, the scan schedule, the change-event debounce, the scope
choices -- and asks ``ProviderOnboarding`` for everything that is a cloud's own
vocabulary (``connectors/onboarding.py``).

That split is new. Until AWS existed this module imported Azure's token
provider, its ARM and Graph clients and its role definitions directly, and
``MULTI_CLOUD.md`` §2 called it the Azure-coupled half of the application --
correctly, and deliberately, because an abstraction guessed from one example is
usually wrong in the places that matter. §8 step 5 scheduled the split for when
a second provider existed to split it for.

The shape underneath is unchanged: CloudGuard hands the customer something to
deploy, proves the grant by *using* it rather than by being told it exists, and
then discovers what is beneath the scope rather than having it typed in.
