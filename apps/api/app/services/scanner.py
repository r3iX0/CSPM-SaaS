"""The scan pipeline.

    collect -> snapshot -> normalize -> persist assets -> evaluate
            -> findings -> risks -> verify fixes -> summarize

Two things here are the product, not plumbing:

* **Every scan writes a snapshot** before anything is interpreted, so a scan can
  be re-evaluated later against improved rules. :meth:`ScanPipeline.replay`
  is that promise being kept: it re-enters the pipeline at ``normalize`` with a
  stored capture and runs the identical remaining stages, so a rule written
  today can be applied to state collected months ago without asking the
  customer for anything.
* **A rescan verifies remediation by itself.** Where a previous scan produced
  FAIL and this one produces PASS, the finding is resolved automatically and
  stamped with the scan that proved it. Nobody clicks "verified"
  (RULE_ENGINE.md section 3).

The two combine into the one rule that constrains replay: **only the newest
snapshot for an account may write findings.** Verification means an observation
was made, and replaying an old capture makes none.

Runs in the Celery worker, which has no authenticated user, so it uses the
owner connection and scopes every write by the ``organization_id`` taken from
the scan record it was handed — never from client input.

    which is exactly what ``TestCaptureReconstruction`` proves adds back up to
    what used to be stored.

    Merged rather than keyed by reading, and that is the case a careless version
    of this gets wrong: one task can produce several payload keys.
    ``authentication_methods`` has no task of its own -- the directory's
    role-map task reads it -- so a rebuild that assumed one key per reading
    would drop it, and the MFA rule would find nothing to judge while reporting
    no error at all.

    A missing blob is refused rather than silently skipped. Half a capture
    replays as an estate that has lost whatever was in the missing half, which
    is the same overclaim as a PASS nobody earned -- retention's interlock
    exists so this cannot happen, and this is what says so if it ever does.

    ``payloads`` is the readings already in hand, keyed by content hash. A
    tenant-wide scan rebuilds one capture per subscription and each rebuild was
    a query of its own, so a fifty-subscription analysis opened with fifty
    round trips before it read a rule -- see :meth:`ScanPipeline._payloads_for`,
    which fetches the lot in one. Absent, this asks for its own, which is what a
    single-capture caller wants.

    **The manifest decides which form this is, not ``data``.** This used to ask
    whether ``data`` was NULL, and that question could not be answered by the
    column: 0001 created it ``DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb`` and 0027 dropped only its
    NOT NULL, so a capture written as a manifest came back carrying an empty
    object and read as an inline capture of an estate with nothing in it. Every
    scan then failed in ANALYZE, on a capture that had been stored perfectly.
    0029 removes the default and clears those rows; asking about the manifest
