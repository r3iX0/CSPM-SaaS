"""Confirming that a fix took, and saying honestly when it cannot be confirmed.

Three things happen here, and the middle one is the whole feature.

**A claim is recorded.** When a customer marks remediation done, CloudGuard
writes down what it now expects to see: this rule, on this asset, should PASS.
Before that the expectation existed only in the customer's head, so nothing
could look for it and nothing could report on it.

**Observations settle the claim.** Every scan that reaches a verdict on that
pair settles the verification or spends one attempt of a backoff. The backoff
exists because a cloud takes time to agree with itself: a check run a minute
after a configuration change reports the environment as it was, and answering
"still failing" then is how a verification feature teaches its customers not to
believe it.

**The answer distinguishes three failures.** Not verified covers "the fix did
not work", "CloudGuard could not see" and "it is too soon", and those need
three different sentences to three different people. That is the FAIL/UNKNOWN
distinction the rule algebra already draws, carried up to the one screen where
somebody is being told whether their work counted.
