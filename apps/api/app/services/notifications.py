"""Turning what happened into what is worth saying.

Derived from the event rows a scan already writes, never produced beside them.
The scanner is the one source of truth about what happened; a second write path
would let a notification and a finding disagree, and the notification is the one
nobody would test. It also means a replay generates nothing for free -- it
writes no finding events, so there is nothing here to read.

**Three kinds, and the shortness is the design.** The bar is not severity:
severity is the rulebook's opinion, while the product's argument is that what
matters is what a finding means on *this* asset. The bar is whether somebody
would want to be interrupted.

  * a new finding on an asset an attacker can actually reach
  * a fix CloudGuard watched work
  * a reading that stopped arriving, because the score is then measuring
    something narrower than it was yesterday

Everything else belongs on a screen somebody chose to open. ``/changes`` already
answers "what moved in the environment"; this answers "what happened since you
last looked", and blurring the two would build a second changes feed with a
worse layout.
