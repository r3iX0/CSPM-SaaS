"""Letting go of evidence without letting go of what it proved.

Two things grow without bound and neither has ever been pruned: the raw captures
in ``cloud_snapshots``, and the content-addressed payloads in
``evidence_blobs``. Both are kept for good reasons -- a capture is what lets a
scan be re-evaluated against improved rules, and a payload is what a citation
points at -- and both are the largest rows in the schema.

**The invariant this must not break.** The newest capture for each subscription
is what an *applied* replay reads: a replay of the newest snapshots may resolve
findings, and every older one is advisory and may not (``scanner.py``,
``evaluation_only``). Pruning a newest capture would not fail loudly -- it would
quietly turn "did the fix work" into an answer nobody can act on. So it is
excluded by construction here rather than by choosing a window long enough that
it probably will not happen.

**What is deliberately not pruned.** ``evidence`` rows are the provenance
record, and they are small: one row per key per subscription per scan, against a
payload that is the listing itself. They are also what a finding's citation
joins to. Deleting the record of what was read to save the size of the record of
what was read is the wrong trade, and it is the trade that would make a finding
raised last year unanswerable.

The order matters: captures first, then payloads. A payload is kept alive by
being re-read rather than by being referenced, so pruning captures cannot orphan
one -- but doing payloads first would leave a window where a capture points at
bytes that have just gone.

    directory pruned out from under it would leave the identity rules with
    nothing to read while the subscription rules carried on.

    Two limits, because a window on its own is a policy about time and storage
    is not spent in time. A customer scanning every half hour writes 48 captures
    a day per subscription and 1,440 inside a 30-day window; a customer scanning
    weekly writes 4. Both are inside the same stated retention, and the tables
