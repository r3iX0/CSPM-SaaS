    """What a customer has told CloudGuard about one subscription.

    Everything else in this schema is something CloudGuard observed. This is the
    one table holding something it was *told*, and that is why it exists
    separately rather than as three more columns on ``cloud_accounts``: a
    discovered subscription is a record of what Azure said, and overwriting
    fields of it with what a person believes would mix two kinds of fact that
    have to stay tellable apart -- not least because discovery runs again.

    Inference from tags is a guess. A person saying "this subscription is
    production" is not, and it beats any amount of tag archaeology
    (``ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md`` §12 item 11). The scan pipeline applies these as
    a *floor*: a declaration can raise an asset's criticality but never lower
    what the capture already showed, so the worst a mistaken declaration can do
    is over-rank something.

    Scoped to a subscription and nothing finer. Per-resource declarations are
    the obvious next ask and are deliberately a later migration rather than a
    nullable column nothing writes -- speculative scope on the one table whose
    job is to record what somebody actually said would be a poor joke.
