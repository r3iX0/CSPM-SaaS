"""What happened that a person has not seen yet.

Deliberately not a second copy of ``/changes``. That answers "what moved in the
environment" and is a property of the estate; this answers "what happened since
you last looked" and is a property of a reader. Blur them and the bell becomes a
worse-laid-out changes feed, and two screens argue about the same estate.

Derived from the event rows a scan already writes rather than written by the
scanner itself. Two consequences worth stating:

* There is one source of truth about what happened. A second write path would
  mean the notification and the finding could disagree, and the notification is
  the one nobody would test.
* A replay generates nothing, for free. It writes no finding events, so there is
  nothing to derive -- which is the correct behaviour and would otherwise have
  had to be remembered.
