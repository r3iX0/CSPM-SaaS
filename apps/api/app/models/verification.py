    """A claim that something was fixed, and CloudGuard's attempt to confirm it.

    "Verified fixed" is the strongest thing this product says, and until now the
    machinery behind it was a coincidence: a customer marked a task done, ran a
    scan whenever they got round to it, and the pipeline resolved the finding if
    that scan happened to produce a PASS. Nothing recorded what was expected,
    nothing looked again on its own, and every way of not-being-verified came
    out as the same silence -- the finding simply stayed open.

    A row here is the expectation, written the moment the customer claims the
    fix: this rule, on this asset, should now PASS. Every scan that reaches a
    verdict on that pair settles it or spends an attempt, and the attempts run
    on a backoff because a cloud takes time to agree with itself -- a check run
    a minute after a change reports the environment as it was, and reporting
    that as "still failing" teaches the customer to distrust the answer.

    The outcomes are deliberately three rather than two. STILL_FAILING is
    CloudGuard looking and disagreeing; INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE is CloudGuard
    failing to look. The second is CloudGuard's problem to explain rather than
    the customer's to fix, and telling them apart is the same discipline that
    keeps UNKNOWN out of PASS everywhere else in this system.
