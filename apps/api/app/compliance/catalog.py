"""The framework catalogue -- what the control identifiers on rules mean.

Rules already carry framework references (``rules.compliance_mappings``), but a
reference is only half of a mapping: ``A.8.20`` tells a user nothing on its own.
This module is the other half, and it is **data, not logic**. Nothing here
branches on a framework, and no rule ever imports it -- which is what keeps
PRODUCT_SPEC.md requirement 15 true while still being able to render a coverage
page.

Three deliberate choices, each of which changes what the coverage number means:

**Control titles are CloudGuard's own words.** CIS Benchmarks and ISO/IEC 27001
are copyrighted works under licences that restrict redistribution of their text;
GDPR is public law but is quoted in summary here for consistency. So every title
below is a short descriptor written for this product, not the official wording.
The identifiers are the durable part -- follow ``url`` for authoritative text.

**Uncovered areas are in the catalogue on purpose.** A catalogue containing only
the controls CloudGuard happens to check would report 100% coverage forever,
which is worse than reporting nothing. Entries a rule cannot reach are listed
too, and resolve to NOT_COVERED.

**Gaps are listed at whatever resolution is honest.** Where CloudGuard covers a
specific control it is listed specifically; where a whole area is unchecked, the
benchmark's own section number is listed rather than inventing leaf numbers to
mark absent. A wrong control number in a compliance view is worse than a coarse
one.

None of this produces a compliance claim. It produces evidence, mapped to a
requirement, attributed to a framework -- the chain in ROADMAP.md, no further.
