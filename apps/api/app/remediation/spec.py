"""Remediation as data: what must become true, and the artifacts that make it so.

A rule's remediation was a paragraph of prose. Good prose -- portal clicks and a
CLI command -- and unusable by anything except a person reading it. Three things
were therefore impossible.

**Saying what "fixed" means.** A verification records that a customer claims a
fix and waits for the rule to pass, which is the right test and a poor
explanation: the customer is told CloudGuard will check, not what it will check
for. An expected state says it in the terms of the setting itself.

**Preventing the next one.** The fix closes today's finding. A policy that
refuses the misconfiguration closes the whole class of it, and the policy is
derivable from the same statement of what must be true -- the ``rbac.py``
pattern applied a second time: one declaration, several generated artifacts,
tests holding them to each other.

**Being honest about what cannot be automated.** Not every check has an ARM
policy behind it. Whether an administrator has MFA is a directory setting, not a
resource property, and no ``policyRule`` can express it. A generator that
invented one would produce a deployment that fails atomically -- the exact
failure mode ``rbac.py`` records for a permission string nobody verified. So a
policy is declared where one genuinely exists and omitted where it does not, and
the API says which.

The strings that reach Azure -- policy aliases -- carry the same rule as the
RBAC actions do: verified before they are written down, because an alias that
looks plausible and is not real fails the customer's deployment rather than
producing a warning.
