"""What CloudGuard needs AWS IAM to allow, and the stack that grants it.

The direct analogue of ``azure/rbac.py``, and deliberately the same discipline:
every action is declared here, every action is reached by a real collector call,
and a test enforces both directions. An action nothing calls has never been
checked against AWS by anything.

Two differences from the Azure role are worth stating, because they change what
a mistake costs.

**AWS does not validate a policy atomically against a list of real operations.**
ARM refuses an entire role definition for one string that is not a genuine
provider operation, which is what made ``Microsoft.Security/autoProvisioningSettings/read``
fail a whole deployment. IAM accepts a policy naming an action that does not
exist; it simply grants nothing. That is *worse*, not better: the deployment
succeeds, the customer sees green, and the reading fails at scan time with
``AccessDenied`` several minutes in.

**So the bulk comes from AWS's own managed policies.** ``SecurityAudit`` and
``ViewOnlyAccess`` are maintained by AWS, cover almost everything here, and
cannot contain a typo of ours. The inline policy holds only what they do not,
which keeps the hand-written surface small enough to review by eye.

.. warning::

   Every action string below is written from the published service reference
   and **has not been verified against a live account**. Entries carry
   ``# UNVERIFIED`` until the checklist in ``docs/AWS_INTEGRATION.md`` §1 has
   been run. Bump :data:`POLICY_VERSION` when the set changes, so a customer
   running an older stack can be offered a redeploy rather than silently
   collecting UNKNOWN.
