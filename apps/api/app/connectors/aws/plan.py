"""AWS's collection plans: what to gather, where, and what each piece needs.

Two plans, as on Azure, because a scan reads two different things. The
**account** plan reads one AWS account -- its IAM, its buckets, and every
regional service in every region that account has enabled. The **organization**
plan reads the trust boundary once for the whole scan, which on AWS means the
account list and nothing else: IAM is per account, unlike an Entra directory,
so identity belongs to the account plan rather than above it.

The fan-out is the part with no Azure equivalent. ``ec2:DescribeRegions`` is
read first, before the plan exists, because the plan's *shape* depends on the
answer -- one task per (listing x region). When that read fails the regional
tasks are still emitted, exactly one per key with no region, each depending on
the region listing; the executor then records them SKIPPED. That is the case
worth being careful about: a key with no reading at all produces no gap, so a
rule would see no error, evaluate against nothing, and PASS. The skipped tasks
are what stop a failed region listing from being read as an empty estate.

Every task declares the actions it needs, and ``iam.py`` is checked against
those declarations in both directions.

.. warning::

   Nothing here has been run against a live AWS account. Operation names,
   response keys and pagination shapes come from the published API reference;
   ``docs/AWS_INTEGRATION.md`` §1 is the checklist that makes them verified.
