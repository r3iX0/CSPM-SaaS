"""What a rule needs, named in a way that cannot silently stop matching.

A rule declares the evidence it depends on and the engine degrades it to UNKNOWN
when that evidence did not arrive. Until now both halves of that were bare
strings -- ``requires_collection = ["identity"]`` on one side, ``category=
"identity"`` on a collection task on the other -- with nothing checking that the
two ever met. A typo did not fail: it produced a rule that never degraded,
which is the one failure mode this whole mechanism exists to prevent. There was
already one in the tree, ``has_collection_error("identity", "mfa")``, where no
task has ever produced ``mfa``.

Two levels, because two different questions are being asked.

**Evidence keys** name one unit of collection -- one listing, one query. This is
what a rule should depend on, because it is the finest thing that can fail on
its own: a subscription whose PostgreSQL listing failed has still read its SQL
servers perfectly well, and the SQL rule has no business going UNKNOWN over it.
Keys are provider-specific, so they live beside the provider that produces them.

**Evidence categories** group keys into the buckets that share a permission and
an explanation. This is what the customer's role grants, what the scan banner
reports, and what a stale role deployment degrades. Categories are neutral: an
AWS network listing and an Azure one are both NETWORK.

The mapping between the two lives with the keys, so a task never declares its
own category and the two can never disagree.
