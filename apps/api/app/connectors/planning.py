"""What a scan is going to collect, decided before it collects anything.

Until now a collection plan was a list: eleven tasks for a subscription, three
for the directory, run in full every time whatever the scan was for and whatever
CloudGuard already held. Nothing wrong with the list -- every entry earned its
place -- but nothing derived it either, so two questions had no answer.

**Does anything use this?** A listing is collected because a rule reads it or
because the product needs it (inventory, the graph's identity edges). Both are
declared -- ``requires_evidence`` on one side, :meth:`CloudConnector
.baseline_evidence` on the other -- and until they were unioned and compared
against the plan, a task could go on being collected long after the last rule
that read it was deleted, at the customer's expense and nobody's notice.

**Do we need to read it again?** Evidence carries provenance and a hash, so a
reading from an earlier scan is reusable in principle. In practice almost none
of it should be, and that is a product decision rather than a limitation: a
customer who fixes a storage account and asks CloudGuard to check gets an
answer about the storage account as it is *now*, or the word "verified" means
nothing. Reuse is therefore opt-in per evidence key, off by default, and
allowed only where a stale reading cannot change a verdict. See
:attr:`EvidenceKey.reuse_window`.

A plan is a filter over the tasks a provider offers, never a source of them.
The provider still declares how each key is collected and what it depends on;
the plan says which of those to run and which to carry forward. That direction
matters: a plan naming a key the provider does not produce is a plan asking for
nothing, not a plan inventing a collection task.
