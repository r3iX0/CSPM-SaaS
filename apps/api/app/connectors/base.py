Azure is the only implementation in v0.1, but the seam is real: everything above
this line (rule engine, risk engine, findings, UI) speaks in ``CloudResource``

a collector and a normalizer, not reshaping the core (ARCHITECTURE.md section 6).

The pipeline is fixed and each stage is separately testable:
