"""What CloudGuard needs Azure RBAC to allow, and the ARM template that grants it.

Every action here is ``*/read``. The custom role contains these and nothing
else -- no ``*/action`` entries, no ``listKeys``, no data plane, nothing that
could read the contents of a customer's storage or database. The claim
"CloudGuard cannot perform a single write in your environment" is checkable
from this file, and a test enforces it.

**Every action here is reached by a real collector call, and nothing else is.**
The role was briefly wider, carrying permissions declared ahead of the rules
that would use them. That is no longer the trade being made, for a reason worth
recording: ARM validates a role definition atomically, so a single string that
is not a genuine provider operation fails the entire deployment with
``InvalidActionOrNotAction`` -- and the customer sees "Deployment Failed", not a
note about one permission. ``Microsoft.Security/autoProvisioningSettings/read``
looked exactly as plausible as its neighbours and was not real.

An action a collector call exercises is proven correct the first time that call
succeeds. An action nothing calls has never been checked against Azure by
anything. So the list is now exactly the former, and both directions are
enforced by tests: every call has an action, and every action has a call.

Adding a permission ahead of its rule is still reasonable, but not on trust --
verify the string first with
``az provider operation show --namespace <Namespace>``.

Bump ``ROLE_VERSION`` when the action list changes, so a deployed role that
predates a new rule can be identified and the customer offered a redeploy
rather than silently collecting UNKNOWN results.
