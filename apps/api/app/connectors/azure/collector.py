"""Collection: Azure APIs -> raw snapshot.

Collection never evaluates anything. It gathers, records what it could not
gather, and hands both to the normalizer. That separation is what makes a scan
reproducible and a coverage gap explainable.

What to gather now lives in ``plan.py`` as declared tasks, and
:class:`~app.connectors.collection.CollectionRun` runs them. This module is the
seam between the two: it owns the connection pool, turns the run's coverage
report into the ``errors`` the rule engine already understands, and hands both
to the normalizer.

Every task is isolated. A Storage API timeout records
``errors["storage"] = "..."`` and collection continues; the rules that depend on
storage data then return UNKNOWN rather than evaluating against nothing
(AZURE_INTEGRATION.md section 5). A listing that stopped early is recorded the
same way, which is newer and matters more: a truncated list is not a short list,
it is an unknown one.
