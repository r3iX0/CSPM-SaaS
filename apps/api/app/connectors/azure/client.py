    a wave of nine tasks, eight detail calls apiece -- multiply to seventy-odd
    requests against one subscription, and the number moves every time a task
    is added to the plan. Azure answers that with 429s, which the retry path
    then turns into wall-clock time, and past the retry budget into recorded
    gaps: a scan that collects less because it asked for more at once.

    So the cap is expressed once, over the thing Azure actually meters --
    requests -- rather than over tasks, which are only a proxy for requests and
    a worse one after every plan change. The per-task limits stay: they are
    fairness between tasks inside one wave, not protection for the
    subscription. This is the protection.

    A permit is held for one HTTP attempt and released before any retry sleep,
    so a throttled call waits without holding a slot the rest of the plan
    could use. Nothing acquires a permit while holding another, and no task
    waits on another task's request, so there is no cycle here to deadlock on.
