"""Every unit of evidence CloudGuard collects from Azure.

One member per collection task. The task declares which it produces, the rule
declares which it needs, and the executor's coverage report is keyed by the same
values -- so "this rule lost its verdict because that listing failed" is one
lookup rather than three strings agreeing by hand.

Each key knows its own category. Tasks therefore do not declare one, which
removes the way the two used to drift: a task whose key said storage and whose
category said network was a perfectly valid thing to write, and the only symptom
was a rule that quietly never degraded.

# Evidence CloudGuard collects because the product needs it, not because a rule
# judges it. Every other key in the plans above is named by some rule's
# ``requires_evidence``; these are named by none, and would therefore be dropped
# the moment a plan is derived from the rule set rather than written out by
# hand.
#
# The authorization listings earn their place plainly: they are what the asset
# graph's identity edges are built from -- who holds which role, and what that
# role permits -- so dropping them costs every privilege path at once. The two
# control readings earn theirs the same way, as the defences that lower a
# finding's score rather than raise one.
#
# ``RESOURCES`` is the one to be honest about. This comment used to claim the
# customer's asset list was made of it. It is not: every asset CloudGuard shows
# comes from the per-service listings -- the storage listing, the SQL listing,
# the virtual machine listing -- normalized into ``cloud_resources``. The
# Resource Graph payload is stored verbatim in the snapshot and read by nothing,
# today, anywhere.
#
# It is kept because of what it is rather than what it does: the only reading
# that covers the resource types no rule has been written for, which is the
# evidence behind the sentence the product cannot yet say -- "you have forty
# resources CloudGuard does not check". Until something says that, this is a
# query per subscription per scan and a stored blob for a capability that does
# not exist, and the honest options are to build it or to stop asking.
#
# Declared here rather than inferred, because "no rule needs it" and "nothing
# needs it" are different statements and only the second is a reason to stop
