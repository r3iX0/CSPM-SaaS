"""Azure's collection plans: what to gather, and what each piece needs.

Two plans, not one, because a scan reads two different things. ARM answers
questions about a *subscription* and is asked once per subscription;
Graph answers questions about the *tenant* and must be asked once for the whole
scan. Collecting both under one plan meant the directory was re-read for every
subscription -- and, worse than the cost, normalized into a separate set of user
resources each time, so one administrator without MFA produced one finding per
subscription.

One entry per listing, rather than one per category. That granularity is the
whole reason the plan exists -- ``_collect_network`` used to gather NSGs, NICs
and public IPs under a single ``try``, so a failure reading public IPs took the
NSG data with it and every network rule reported UNKNOWN over data that had
arrived intact.

Each task also carries the ARM actions it needs. ``rbac.py`` derives the
permission set from this, so a listing and the permission that grants it can no
longer disagree: adding a task without its action fails a test rather than
reaching a customer as a 403 inside one collection category.

Every task gets its own client over a shared connection pool. Truncation is
recorded per client, and tasks in a wave run concurrently -- a single shared
client would record a truncated listing without saying which task it belonged
to, and the resulting PARTIAL would be attributed to whichever task happened to
be awaiting at the time.
