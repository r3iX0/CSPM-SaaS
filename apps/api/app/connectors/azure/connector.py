# The Graph calls collection depends on, each paired with the permission that
# grants it. Verifying by calling is the only verification available: Graph
# exposes no "what am I consented to" endpoint, and a consent screen that was
# clicked is not evidence that the grant covers what CloudGuard needs today.
#
# These are exactly the two calls ``_collect_identity`` makes before anything
# else, plus the tenant read that proves consent happened at all. The deeper
# identity calls are absent on purpose -- they already degrade to UNKNOWN
# individually, so they cost a category rather than a connection.
# The call is the function itself, not its name. Looking it up with getattr
# inside the same try that catches a 403 would turn a rename into a permission
# diagnosis: every customer told to change their Entra configuration to fix a
# typo in ours. Referencing the method here fails at import instead.
