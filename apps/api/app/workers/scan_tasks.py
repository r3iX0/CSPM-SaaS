"""Scan tasks.

Every task takes ids and nothing else. Organization, cloud account and
subscription are read from the records inside the worker, so a queue message can
never be the source of a tenant boundary decision.

A scan is driven by two tasks rather than performed by one. ``advance_scan``
asks what may run now and claims it; ``run_scan_step`` performs one claimed step
and asks again. That is the whole loop, and it is what makes a scan survive the
worker it started on -- the state lives in ``scan_steps``, not in a Python
frame.
