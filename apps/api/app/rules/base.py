"""The rule contract.

Rules are deterministic functions of a snapshot. No network, no database, no
LLM -- given the same normalized input a rule must always return the same
result, or "CloudGuard verified the fix" would mean nothing.

The four states are not three states plus an error case:

* ``PASS``            -- we looked, and it is fine.
* ``FAIL``            -- we looked, and it is wrong. Becomes a Finding.
* ``UNKNOWN``         -- we could not look. Never a Finding, never a PASS.
* ``NOT_APPLICABLE``  -- the rule has nothing to say about this resource.

The UNKNOWN/PASS distinction is the one that carries the most weight. A storage
API that timed out must not quietly read as "no public storage found".
