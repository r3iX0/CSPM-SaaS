"""IAM rules: who can sign in, with what, and how long ago they last did.

Everything here reads IAM's credential report rather than the user listing.
``ListUsers`` says a user exists; the report says whether MFA is on, which keys
are active and when each was last used -- and those are the only facts any of
these rules turn on.

Ages come off the resource, computed by the normalizer against the capture's own
``collected_at``. A rule that read the clock would answer differently on replay,
which would make "verified fixed" a statement about when somebody asked.
