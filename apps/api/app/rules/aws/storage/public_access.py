"""S3 rules. The classic cloud data-leak shape, in AWS's vocabulary.

Provider-specific rules over a neutral resource type, which is the decision
``MULTI_CLOUD.md`` §6 records and the reason it was not aesthetic: ``remediation``
is snapshot-copied onto every finding, and ``aws s3api put-public-access-block``
is not a variant of ``az storage account update``. A shared rule would branch on
provider to produce the fix, which is the same mistake as branching on framework
name.
