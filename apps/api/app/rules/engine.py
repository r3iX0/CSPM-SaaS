"""Rule evaluation.

Takes normalized state, returns verdicts. It touches no database and no cloud
API, which is what makes a scan reproducible: feed the same snapshot in twice
and you get the same findings out.

Two invariants live here, and both matter more than they look:

* A rule that raises is UNKNOWN, never PASS. A crashing rule must degrade
  coverage, not silently declare the environment healthy.
* PASS and NOT_APPLICABLE are counted, not stored per-resource. UNKNOWN is
  stored individually, because each one is a specific thing we failed to check.
