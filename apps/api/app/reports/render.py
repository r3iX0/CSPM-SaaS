"""Turn a report dictionary into HTML, and HTML into a PDF.

Split in two on purpose, and the split is what makes this testable. HTML is a
first-class artifact here rather than an intermediate: it is what the templates
produce, it is what the tests assert against, and it is what the API can serve
directly for a reader who wants to look at a report rather than file it.

PDF generation is the thin layer on top. WeasyPrint needs native libraries --
pango, cairo, harfbuzz -- that are present in the deployed image and are not
present on every developer's machine, so it is imported at call time rather
than at module import. A missing library then produces one clear sentence about
the server's configuration instead of breaking every import that transitively
reaches this module, including the ones that only ever wanted HTML.
