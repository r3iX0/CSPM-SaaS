"""Database engines and the RLS-scoped session.

Two connections, deliberately:

* ``get_app_engine()``  -- logs in as ``cloudguard_app``, which owns nothing and is
  therefore fully subject to Row-Level Security. Every request-path query goes
  through here.
* ``get_owner_engine()`` -- the table owner. Used by migrations and by the Celery
  worker, which has no authenticated user to resolve policies against. Worker
  code must scope by ``organization_id`` explicitly, taken from the scan record
  it was handed -- never from client input.

The request session emulates exactly what Supabase's PostgREST does: it sets
``request.jwt.claims`` and switches to the ``authenticated`` role for the life
of the transaction. That means one set of RLS policies works identically
against local PostgreSQL and against a real Supabase project.

    The worker's counterpart to :func:`rls_session`, and it resolves tenancy
    differently for a reason: a background scan has no signed-in user, so there
    is no membership to look up. It declares the organization it is acting for,
    and ``cloudguard_worker``'s policy arm trusts that declaration -- an arm
    granted to that role alone, so the request path gains no bypass from it.

    **The claim is re-declared on every transaction, and that is the whole
    subtlety.** ``SET LOCAL`` is transaction-scoped, which is exactly what stops
    it leaking to the next checkout of a pooled connection -- and it also means
    it dies at the pipeline's first ``commit``. The pipeline commits many times:
    per phase, per subscription, per stage. Declaring the claim once at the top
    left every statement after the first commit running with no organization at
    all, which under this role's policies means seeing an empty database.

    So it is re-issued by an ``after_begin`` listener rather than by the caller
    remembering. A caller who had to remember would eventually not, and the
    failure is silent: no error, just a scan that reads nothing and writes
    nothing.

    Unlike :func:`rls_session`, the transaction is **not** owned here. The
    pipeline commits as it goes -- collection is durable before evaluation
    starts, which is the property replay depends on -- so wrapping it in one
    long transaction would both undo that and break at the first commit.

    Falls back to the owner connection where no worker role is configured, in
    which case this is exactly the old unconstrained session and the pipeline's
    own filters are all that scope it. That is the previous behaviour, kept
    deliberately so the role can be adopted without a flag day.
