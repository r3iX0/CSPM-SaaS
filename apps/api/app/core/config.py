"""Application settings.

CloudGuard runs in one place: a managed cloud environment (Supabase for
PostgreSQL and Auth, Railway for the API and worker, Vercel for the frontend).
There is deliberately no local-development mode and no localhost defaults --
every value below has to be supplied by the environment, and the app refuses to
start if any of them is missing or obviously wrong.

That refusal is the point. Every setting checked here is one that would let the
process boot, look healthy, and be trivially exploitable: a known JWT secret
lets anyone mint a token for any user; a stale APP_URL strands a customer
mid-consent. Failing the deploy is the kinder outcome for a security product.
