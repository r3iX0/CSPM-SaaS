"""What CloudGuard is allowed to say about a fix somebody claims to have made.

"Verified fixed" is the strongest sentence this product produces, so the policy
that decides when it may be said is worth testing on its own, without a database
or a scan in the way. The cases divide into two halves and both are about
honesty rather than mechanics:

* An early FAIL is not a failed fix. A cloud applies a change to its control
  plane before every read path agrees about it, so a check run a minute after
  the work reports the environment as it was -- and reporting *that* as "still
  failing" is how a verification feature teaches its customers not to believe
  it.
* Failing to look is not looking and disagreeing. STILL_FAILING and
  INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE are different news for different people, and collapsing
  them is the same overclaim as counting an UNKNOWN as a PASS.
