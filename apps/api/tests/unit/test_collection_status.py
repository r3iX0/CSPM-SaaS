What a scan managed to read was a map of category to a sentence: assembled for
a person and answerable by nothing else. It could not say whether a category
had failed outright or merely come back truncated -- an outage and a tenant
larger than one scan reads, reported identically -- nor which subscription it
happened in, which is the first question a tenant-wide scan raises.

These cover the shape of the record and the summary drawn from it. The write
path needs a database and is exercised in the integration suite.
