"""The admin-consent URL.

This URL has now been wrong three times, each failure landing on Microsoft's
error page rather than in CloudGuard: a callback path that moved when
connections replaced per-subscription accounts, a redirect URI pasted from the
deployment guide with its placeholder intact, and a missing ``scope`` that the
v2.0 endpoint requires (``AADSTS900144``).

They share a shape. The URL is assembled from configuration, handed to a
browser, and only judged by a server CloudGuard does not own -- so nothing in
this codebase noticed, and the person who found out was a customer's Global
Administrator standing in front of an AADSTS code. Asserting on the assembled
URL is the only place that shape can be caught cheaply.
