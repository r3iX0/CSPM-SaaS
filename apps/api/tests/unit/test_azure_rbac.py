"""The least-privilege role, and the ARM template that grants it.

The first test is the one that matters. A custom role is only least-privilege
if it is *complete* -- an ARM call with no matching action fails in production
as a 403 buried in one collection category, which surfaces as UNKNOWN rather
than as an error anybody reads. The reverse direction matters too: an action
with no call is a permission CloudGuard asks for and never uses, which is
exactly what a security reviewer looks for on the consent screen.
