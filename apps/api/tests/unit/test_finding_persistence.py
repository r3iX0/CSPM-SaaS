"""Writing findings: one row per finding, one junction row per risk.

Both invariants here were broken at once by a batching change and caught only
by CI, because nothing that runs without a database touched this code. A fake
session is enough to hold them: what matters is which objects are handed to
``session.add``, not what PostgreSQL does with them afterwards.

The duplicate case is not hypothetical. A rule may report the same resource
more than once in a single scan -- AZ-CMP-001 does, when one VM is guarded by
the same NSG through two interfaces -- while ``findings`` is unique on
(organization, rule, resource). Reading the existing findings once and then
forgetting to register newly created ones meant the second report built a rival
row for a key the first had already claimed.
