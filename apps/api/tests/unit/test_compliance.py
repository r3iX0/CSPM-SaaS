"""Framework catalogue integrity and per-control status resolution.

The first half is the test that actually earns its place. Rules reference
controls as bare strings; nothing in Python checks that ``A.8.20`` is a control
that exists. A typo there does not fail -- it quietly produces a control nobody
can find and a rule whose evidence goes nowhere, which in a compliance view is
the kind of wrong that gets believed.
