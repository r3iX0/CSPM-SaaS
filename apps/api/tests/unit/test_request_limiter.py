"""The ceiling on how much of a subscription a scan asks for at once.

Concurrency in the collector is nested, and nobody owned the product of it. A
wave of tasks runs together; several of those tasks fan out per resource under
their own semaphore. Both numbers look modest and their product does not, and
it moves every time a task joins the plan -- so the limit belongs over
requests, which is what Azure meters, rather than over tasks, which are a proxy
that gets worse with every plan change.
