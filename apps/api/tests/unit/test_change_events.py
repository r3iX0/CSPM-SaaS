"""Reacting to a change without reacting to each one.

Three things decide whether an Event Grid path is worth having, and each is a
way for it to be actively harmful if wrong.

The **handshake** must be answered or the subscription never activates -- a
customer whose `az eventgrid` command appeared to succeed would simply never be
told about anything, which is worse than not offering the feature.

The **filter** must drop what cannot change a verdict. ARM reports every write
in a subscription, and a scan per tag edit is a denial of service against the
customer's own API limits, paid for by them.

The **debounce** must collapse a deployment into one reading. Forty events in a
minute is one change; treating it as forty is the same storm the filter was
meant to prevent, arriving from a different direction.
