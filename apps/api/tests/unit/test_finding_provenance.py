"""Answering "how do you know?".

The endpoint assembles a citation from three places -- the link, the reading it
points at, and whether the payload is still stored -- and each of the three can
be absent for a different reason. Conflating any two of them turns a checkable
claim back into one a customer has to take on trust, which is the thing the
whole evidence chain exists to avoid.

The distinction these are mostly about: ``None`` means CloudGuard recorded no
citation, ``[]`` would mean the rule reads nothing. A finding raised before the
link existed is the first, and reporting it as the second would be the product
asserting its rule needs no evidence.
