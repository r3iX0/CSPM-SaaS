"""The committed manifest is what actually gets deployed.

``REQUIRED_GRAPH_PERMISSIONS`` is the source of truth in code;
``infrastructure/azure/app-registration.json`` is the file
``apply-app-registration.sh`` hands to ``az ad app update``. If they disagree,
the permission a new rule needs is one no customer has ever been asked to grant
-- and the symptom arrives months later as a 403 inside one collection
category, which is exactly how the identity gap went unnoticed.

CI diffs the two as well. This test exists so the failure is also visible to
someone running the suite locally, before the push.
