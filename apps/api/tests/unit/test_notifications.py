"""What is worth telling somebody, and what is not.

Most of these are about restraint. A CSPM that notifies per finding becomes a
filter rule in the second week, so the interesting assertions are the ones about
what the sweep declines to say -- a real finding on an unreachable asset, a
status a person moved by hand, the same failing listing on every scan.

The judgement lives in ``_reachable_findings`` and friends; these hold it in
place, because every one of them is the kind of rule that gets relaxed by
accident and only shows up as a bell nobody looks at any more.
