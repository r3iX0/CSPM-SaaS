Context is the multiplier the risk engine turns a finding into a risk with, so
every case here is really a case about ranking. Two properties carry the weight:
a declaration can raise a value but never lower one, and every value says where
it came from -- because "CRITICAL" invites the question "says who?" and until
this module there was nowhere the answer existed.
