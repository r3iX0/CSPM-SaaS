"""What a report is allowed to say, and what it must never leave out.

A PDF outlives the screen it was taken from and nobody can ask it a follow-up
question, so the caveats the UI can afford to put behind a tooltip have to be
printed. These tests are mostly about that: coverage gaps, collection failures,
the age of the evidence, and the difference between "no earlier reading" and
"no change".

They assert against the HTML rather than the PDF on purpose. The PDF is that
HTML printed by WeasyPrint, which needs native libraries a developer machine
may not have -- so the layer worth pinning is the one that decides what the
document says.
