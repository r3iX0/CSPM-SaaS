"""Connecting an AWS account: one grant, and the id that guards it.

The flow differs from Azure's in exactly one structural way and everything else
follows: there is no consent step. The customer deploys a stack, and the role it
creates is the whole grant. So a connection must not sit waiting for a consent
that is never coming, and one successful assume-role has to record both columns
Azure fills separately.

The external id is the part with a security consequence. It is generated
server-side when the connection is created, and a role must never be assumed
without one.
