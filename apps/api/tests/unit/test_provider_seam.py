"""Whether "provider-neutral above the connector" is true, or only intended.

`ARCHITECTURE.md` §6 and the connector docstring both claim that everything
above `CloudConnector` speaks in `CloudResource` and never in one cloud's terms,
so adding a second provider means writing a connector rather than reshaping the
core. That claim was **false in three places** when this test was written, and
each had the same shape: something neutral reaching sideways into
`connectors/azure` because Azure was the only answer it could need.

* the scan pipeline imported Azure's evidence-key enum to work out which keys a
  permission category holds, so a second connector's categories would have
  degraded nothing;
* the permissions endpoint returned Azure's grants for every provider, so the
  first AWS customer would have been told CloudGuard wanted admin consent;
* the change-event service hard-coded ARM operation names and the `az` command.

None of those would have been noticed by a test of behaviour, because with one
provider they all give the right answer. They are only wrong on the day somebody
starts step 2 of `MULTI_CLOUD.md` §8 -- which is the day this test exists for.
