"""Finding out what consent granted, at consent time and at scan time.

The failure this closes was reported from a live tenant: a connection that
validated green, then a scan whose ``users`` and ``directory_roles`` tasks both
came back "Insufficient privileges to complete the operation" -- a sentence
naming neither the permission, nor who can grant it, nor that the subscription
half of the connection was fine.

Two places knew and neither said so. The consent callback recorded GRANTED on
Entra's redirect alone, and the collector had only a generic hint to offer. The
token carried the answer the whole time.
