"""Route-table hygiene.

FastAPI matches routes in declaration order, so a literal path declared after a
parameterised one that could also match it is simply unreachable. That is a
quiet failure: the request lands on the wrong handler and fails for the wrong
reason.

This checks every router rather than the one that had the bug.
