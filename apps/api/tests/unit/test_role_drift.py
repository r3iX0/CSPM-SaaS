"""What happens when a customer's deployed role falls behind the scanner.

``CloudConnection.role_version`` has been stamped at creation since connections
existed, and nothing ever read it back. That made it a label rather than a
mechanism: bumping ``ROLE_VERSION`` to ship a check needing a new ARM action
would leave every existing customer collecting UNKNOWN for it, with no prompt
and nothing on screen to explain why.

The tests that matter here are the two guards. One catches a version bumped
without recording what the old version granted -- without that record there is
no way to know which checks a deployed role cannot serve. The other catches a
collection category renamed out from under the explanation, which would leave
the drift silent again in a different way.
