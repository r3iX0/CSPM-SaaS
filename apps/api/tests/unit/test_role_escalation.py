"""Which roles can hand out roles, read from the definition rather than the name.

The whole template rests on one distinction, and getting it wrong in either
direction ruins it. **Owner and Contributor both carry ``actions: ["*"]``** --
the only thing separating them is that Contributor excludes
``Microsoft.Authorization/*/Write`` in its ``notActions``. Matching on role
names, or on actions without honouring the exclusions, would report every
Contributor assignment in existence as a privilege escalation path, which is
the kind of false alarm that gets a feature switched off rather than fixed.

The other direction matters too: a tenant's own custom role granting exactly
this one action is invisible to any list of well-known names, and is precisely
the thing worth finding.
