"""Replaying a stored snapshot, and the interlock that keeps it honest.

Every scan has always written the provider's own JSON to ``cloud_snapshots``
before interpreting any of it, on the promise that the scan could be
re-evaluated later against better rules. These tests cover the two halves of
keeping that promise: a snapshot must survive the round trip through the
database unchanged, and a replay of an old one must not be allowed to pass
itself off as an observation.

The second is the dangerous one. Auto-resolution treats a PASS where there was
a FAIL as proof of a fix. Replay a month-old capture against a newly written
rule and that machinery would happily stamp findings "verified fixed" on the
strength of data collected before anyone knew the rule existed -- nothing was
looked at, so nothing may be resolved.
