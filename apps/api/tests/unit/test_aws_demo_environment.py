"""The recorded AWS environment, through the whole pipeline.

Nothing in `app/connectors/aws/` has been run against a live account, so this is
the closest thing to end-to-end proof the code has: a capture in the shape the
collector produces, normalized by the real normalizer, judged by the real rules,
with the verdicts pinned.

What it proves is that everything *after* the provider works — the regional
blocks unwrap, the per-bucket readings join, the graph resolves its capability
hop, every rule reaches a verdict and none of them reaches UNKNOWN over evidence
that arrived. What it cannot prove is the half `docs/AWS_INTEGRATION.md` §1
covers: whether the payloads it replays are the payloads AWS actually sends.

It is also the seed's fixture (`database/seed/demo_environment.py --provider
aws`), which is deliberate. A demo assembled from fabricated findings would
prove nothing about the code that produces them, and a fixture nobody looks at
drifts from the product it is supposed to describe.
