"""Which captures survive a prune.

The deletes themselves are SQL and are held against a real database in
``tests/integration/test_scan_pipeline.py``. What lives here is the part that is
Python and is the part that decides: a capture is deleted if it is outside the
window *and* is not the newest of its scope, and getting that composition wrong
loses the one capture an applied replay reads.

Worth a unit test as well as an integration one because the failure is silent.
Pruning a newest capture raises nothing; it turns "did the fix work" into an
advisory answer, months later, on the path the north-star metric runs through.
