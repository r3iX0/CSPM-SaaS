    ``dispose_engines`` rather than an enumerated list, and that is the point of
    the change: this fixture used to name the app and owner engines by hand, so
    adding a third -- the worker connection, whose row-level security holds a
    scan to one organization -- left its pool undrained and turned fifty-odd
    integration tests into "got Future attached to a different loop". The
