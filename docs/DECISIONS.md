# CloudGuard — Implementation Decisions

Where the build made a choice the specification did not fully determine, or
deviated from it, the reasoning is recorded here. Companion to the spec, not a
replacement for it.

---

## 1. RLS is enforced against a non-owner role

**Spec:** "Tenant isolation enforced by PostgreSQL RLS, independent of app
logic" (requirement 4).

PostgreSQL exempts a table's owner from its own RLS policies unless
`FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` is set. If the API connected as the owner — the
default for most FastAPI/SQLAlchemy setups — every policy in the schema would be
silently inert, and requirement 4 would be decorative.

So there are two database roles:

| Role | Used by | RLS |
|---|---|---|
| `cloudguard` (owner) | migrations, Celery worker | exempt |
| `cloudguard_app` | every API request | **enforced** |

Each request opens a transaction that sets `request.jwt.claims` and switches to
the `authenticated` role — precisely what Supabase's PostgREST does — so one set
of policies works unchanged against local PostgreSQL and a real Supabase
project. `app/core/db.py::rls_session`.

`FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` is deliberately **not** set: the membership lookup
inside a policy runs through a `SECURITY DEFINER` function, and forcing RLS on
the owner would make that function re-enter the policy it is evaluating and
recurse. Not owning the tables is what makes the isolation real; forcing it is
not.

Two tests assert the premise itself rather than only its consequences:
`test_application_role_is_not_the_table_owner` and
`test_application_role_cannot_bypass_rls`.

## 2. Organization creation goes through a SECURITY DEFINER function

Creating an organization is a bootstrap problem: the creator is not yet a
member, so no membership-based INSERT policy can authorize it. Widening the
membership policy enough to allow it would also let any user insert themselves
into any organization.

`app.create_organization()` creates the organization and the creator's OWNER
membership in one transaction. The `organizations` table has no INSERT policy at
all, and `organization_members` accepts inserts only from an existing
OWNER/ADMIN. Covered by `test_cannot_add_self_to_another_organization`.

## 3. Azure is reached over REST with MSAL, not the `azure-mgmt-*` SDKs

**Spec:** the original build spec named "Azure SDK for Python" in
`ARCHITECTURE.md` §1. That table now records the REST decision instead, so this
entry is the reason it changed rather than a live disagreement.

Requirement 9 says every scan stores a snapshot, and the value of that snapshot
is that it holds the provider's *own* JSON, so a scan can be re-evaluated later
against improved rules. Going through SDK model objects would mean deserializing
Azure's JSON into Python objects and then serializing it back out again — losing
fidelity for no gain. The management SDKs are also synchronous, which fits
poorly with an async collector.

Authentication still uses **MSAL**, Microsoft's own library, which is what
actually matters: the multi-tenant client-credentials flow against each
customer's tenant is not something to hand-roll. `httpx` makes the ARM and Graph
calls. `app/connectors/azure/client.py`.

## 4. Relationship edges are stored once, indexed both ways

`resource_relationships` stores an edge in its natural direction (an NSG
*protects* a VM). Both endpoints need to query it, though: AZ-NET-001 asks an
NSG what it is attached to, AZ-CMP-001 asks a VM what guards it. Rather than
writing each edge twice, `RuleContext` derives the reverse index at
construction. `get_related` / `get_related_inverse`.

## 5. UNKNOWN is distinguished from absent at the normalizer, not the rule

A rule can only report UNKNOWN honestly if the normalizer preserved the
difference between "we read this and it was empty" and "we never read this".
The normalizer therefore emits `None` where a call failed and `[]` where it
succeeded and found nothing — and omits `mfa_methods` entirely for users whose
authentication methods were never queried.

`test_unqueried_user_has_no_mfa_key_at_all` and
`test_empty_diagnostics_list_is_not_none` pin this down, because it is the kind
of distinction that erodes silently.

## 6. A rule that raises is UNKNOWN, never PASS

`RuleEngine._safe_evaluate` catches exceptions from rule code and converts them
to UNKNOWN. A crashing rule must degrade coverage, not report a clean
environment. This is the one broad `except` in the evaluation path and it is
load-bearing.

## 7. Asset context defaults to UNKNOWN, not LOW

The risk formula needs asset criticality, data sensitivity and exposure. Most
real environments are partially tagged. The normalizer infers what it can from
tags and naming conventions, then falls back to `UNKNOWN` — which the risk
engine scores at 3.5, just below HIGH.

Defaulting to LOW would quietly discount every untagged production asset, which
is exactly the population most likely to be untagged.

## 8. `Findings` are keyed on (organization, rule, resource)

A re-detection updates the existing row rather than inserting a new one, so
`first_detected_at` means what it says and a finding keeps its identity across
scans. A finding that was RESOLVED and is detected again is reopened rather than
duplicated — a regression is not a historical record.
`test_findings_are_not_duplicated_across_scans`,
`test_a_regression_reopens_a_resolved_finding`.

## 9. Enum columns are varchar with a coercing type decorator

Columns are `varchar` rather than native PostgreSQL enums so adding a value is a
code change rather than a migration that takes a lock. That alone would return
plain strings on read, making `FindingStatus.is_open` fail at runtime on exactly
the paths that matter. `StrEnumType` (`app/models/base.py`) stores the value and
returns the enum.

## 10. Rescanning a finding runs a full scan

`POST /findings/{id}/rescan` queues a complete scan rather than re-running the
single rule. Fixing one thing frequently changes another — closing a public port
may reroute traffic, disabling public network access may orphan a dependency —
and a narrow re-check could report a fix that a wider view would contradict.

## 11. Authentication is Supabase only

Production authentication is Supabase Auth. The browser signs in one of four
ways — Microsoft (Entra ID), email and password, a magic link, or a password
reset — and sends the resulting JWT to this API, which only ever *verifies* it
(`app/core/security.py`). The API cannot tell the routes apart and does not need
to: it checks the signature and reads the user id.

Microsoft is offered first because this is an Azure-first product; the account
someone signs in with is usually the same directory account that later grants
admin consent. That sign-in grants CloudGuard no access to Azure *resources* —
scanning access is the separate consent flow in `AZURE_INTEGRATION.md`.

Passwords are Supabase's to hold. One typed into `SignInPage` is posted directly
to Supabase's auth API over TLS; it never reaches this API, is never logged
here, and there is no column for it in this schema. What remains true without
qualification is that CloudGuard has no token-minting code — the test suite
signs its own tokens rather than the product shipping a code path that hands out
credentials. See #13 for why the earlier development-only variant was deleted
rather than gated.

## 12. shadcn/ui components are hand-written — **superseded by §24**

**Spec:** shadcn/ui (`ARCHITECTURE.md` §1).

shadcn/ui is a copy-in component collection installed via an interactive CLI,
not a dependency. The handful of primitives this prototype needs — badge, card,
button, field, empty state — are written directly in `src/components/ui.tsx` in
the same style (Tailwind + `clsx` + `tailwind-merge`). Running the CLI later to
add richer components remains possible.

## 13. Cloud-only: no local development mode

**Spec:** `ARCHITECTURE.md` §1 listed Docker Compose for local development.

CloudGuard now targets exactly one environment — Supabase, Railway, Vercel —
and cannot be run anywhere else. `docker-compose.yml` and `.env.example` are
gone, there are no localhost defaults in `Settings`, and the API validates its
entire environment at import and refuses to start if anything is missing.

Three things follow, and the third is the point:

* **The dev sign-in route is deleted**, not disabled. It minted a valid token
  for any email address with no password. Gating it behind an environment check
  meant one wrong variable turned it back on in a deployment — as nearly
  happened when Railway's "suggested variables" pre-filled `APP_ENV=development`
  from `.env.example`. Code that cannot be reached by accident is code that is
  not there. `app/core/security.py` now only verifies tokens; the test suite
  signs its own.
* **`APP_ENV` defaults to `production`** and no longer accepts `development`.
  A forgotten variable fails closed rather than silently relaxing every check.
  `test` is the only exemption and exists for CI.
* **Database engines are built lazily.** Removing the localhost defaults meant
  `create_async_engine("")` ran at import and broke test collection. Importing a
  module should not open a connection pool anyway, so `get_app_engine()` /
  `get_owner_engine()` construct on first use.

The cost is real and worth stating: there is no way to run CloudGuard offline,
and the 45 integration tests need the PostgreSQL that CI provisions. The
tradeoff is that a whole class of "worked locally, insecure in production" bug
is now unrepresentable — which for a security product is the right side to
err on.


## 14. Resource Graph reads inventory; ARM reads everything a rule judges

**Spec:** `AZURE_INTEGRATION.md` collected inventory with the ARM resource
listing, one paged call per subscription.

Inventory is the one collection task that asks for every provider's resources
at once, and it is the one that scales worst as a tenant grows. Azure Resource
Graph answers it in a single KQL query per subscription, and — the part that
decides it — states `totalRecords` for the query, so a short read is caught by
comparing two numbers the service supplied. ARM paging could only ever infer
completeness from whether the page cap was reached, which is a guess about the
tail of a list nobody saw.

The split is deliberate and narrow:

* **Resource Graph collects inventory only.** Its rows are a projection of
  ARM's own state and can be minutes stale — fine for "what exists here",
  wrong for the configuration a rule passes or fails on. Every listing a rule
  reads stays on ARM, where the snapshot keeps the provider's JSON verbatim
  (§3), so replay is unaffected.
* **`ResourceGraphClient` is a separate class,** not more methods on
  `ArmClient`. Same host and same retry behaviour; different paging
  (`$skipToken` rather than `nextLink`), different quota (per principal rather
  than per subscription), different error surface. One class would put two
  paging models behind one name and leave a reader unable to tell which one a
  call is subject to.
* **The projection excludes `properties`.** Inventory answers what exists;
  carrying configuration here would hold a second, staler copy of data no rule
  reads in every snapshot.

**Cost:** the custom role gains `Microsoft.ResourceGraph/resources/read` and
`ROLE_VERSION` moves to `v2`. The action string was verified against the
published RBAC operations reference on 2026-08-30 — it is real, and described
as "Submits a query on resources within specified subscriptions, management
groups or tenant scope", so the template deploys. Whether Resource Graph
actually *checks* it is not established: the service documents its requirement
as read access to the resources being queried, and its only documented 403 is a
subscription list the caller cannot read. Granting it is the cheaper side of
that uncertainty, and the connection probe (§14, validation) will settle it —
a `v1` connection whose Resource Graph probe succeeds proves the action
redundant, and the role can then be narrowed. Connections deployed on `v1` lose inventory —
and only inventory — until the customer redeploys, which the role-drift
machinery already tells them to do. Falling back to the ARM listing when the
query is denied would hide that, and leave the customer on a role that will not
serve the next thing built on Resource Graph either.

## 15. Concurrency is capped over requests, not over tasks

**Spec:** none. The plan capped fan-out per task (`DETAIL_CONCURRENCY`) and the
executor ran a whole wave at once.

Those two limits multiply, and nothing owned the product. A wave of nine tasks
with eight detail calls apiece is seventy-odd requests against one
subscription, and the number moves every time a task joins the plan. Azure
answers that with 429s, which the retry path turns into wall-clock time and,
past the retry budget, into recorded gaps: a scan that collects *less* because
it asked for more at once.

`RequestLimiter` caps what Azure actually meters. One limiter per scan is
shared by every client the plan builds, a permit covers a single HTTP attempt,
and it is released before any `Retry-After` sleep — a throttled call must not
hold a slot while it is deliberately not using the network. The per-task limits
stay as fairness between tasks inside a wave; this is the protection for the
subscription.

It also makes the cost visible: `azure.collection_finished` now carries the
request count, the peak in flight and the time spent queued behind the ceiling,
because a scan that never waits and one that waits a minute are otherwise
indistinguishable — and only the second is evidence the number wants changing.

## 16. A scan's collection plan is derived; carrying evidence forward is opt-in per key

**Spec:** `ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md` §7 and §12 item 10 — "the evidence planner:
rule-set union minus fresh evidence".

Two halves, and only the first came out the way the review assumed.

**Derived, not written down.** What a scan collects is now the union of every
enabled rule's `requires_evidence` plus the connector's `baseline_evidence`,
and the provider's plan is filtered through it. Three Azure keys are named by
no rule — inventory, role assignments, role definitions — and they are the
reason the baseline exists rather than an oversight to be tidied away: the
first is what the customer's asset list is made of, and the other two are what
the graph's identity edges are built from. A rule-derived plan without a
declared baseline would have dropped all three while every check carried on
passing.

Today the union equals the plan exactly, so nothing is dropped and no request
is saved. What the derivation buys is that the equality is now checked: a
listing whose last reader was deleted fails a test instead of being collected
at the customer's expense for ever, and a rule added with a new dependency
starts being collected for.

**Reuse is off unless a key earns it.** Evidence has carried provenance and a
content hash since migration 0010, so a complete reading from an earlier scan
can stand in for a new one. Almost none of it should. The strongest claim this
product makes is "verified fixed", and it survives exactly as long as nothing
verifies a fix against evidence collected before the fix: a customer who
corrects a storage account and asks CloudGuard to check must be answered from
the storage account as it is now, or the word means nothing.

So `EvidenceKey.reuse_window` defaults to `None` — read it again — and a window
is granted per key, by the provider that produces it, only where a stale reading
cannot change a verdict. Being expensive to collect or slow to change are
reasons to *want* a window; they are not reasons one is safe. Exactly one Azure
key qualifies today: `role_definitions`, the catalogue of what each role
permits, several hundred near-static rows per subscription that no rule reads.
Role assignments are deliberately excluded on the same reasoning inverted —
they change constantly and every privilege path is drawn from them. A test
fails the build if any key some rule reads is ever given a window.

A carried reading is recorded COMPLETE, because that is what it was: age is not
incompleteness, and degrading it to PARTIAL would tell every rule reading it to
return UNKNOWN. Its evidence row keeps the *original* `collected_at`, so the
next scan's freshness question is asked about the read rather than about the
last scan that reused it — otherwise one reading renews itself for ever.

## 17. Asset context is its own module, and a customer declaration is a floor

**Spec:** `ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md` §12 item 11 — "a context engine as its own
module, out of the normalizer, with every fact carrying source and confidence.
Add customer-declared context."

Context — how critical an asset is, how sensitive its data, which environment it
belongs to — is the multiplier that turns a finding into a risk. It lived in
three helper functions inside the Azure normalizer, which was wrong in two ways.
None of it is Azure-specific, so a second connector would have written its own
slightly different copy of the tag vocabulary and the production/development
word lists. And there was nowhere for the customer to disagree: normalization is
a pure function of a capture, and a declaration is not in the capture.

`app/context/` now holds inference and resolution separately. `infer()` stays
pure and runs in the normalizer's path; `resolve()` applies declarations in the
pipeline, where the database is — read at *evaluation* time rather than frozen
into the capture, so marking a subscription production changes how its findings
rank today, including on a replay of an older reading.

**Every value carries its source.** `ContextSource` runs NONE → INFERRED →
TYPE_FLOOR → PROVIDER_TAG → INHERITED → CUSTOMER, and confidence is a property
*of* the source rather than a column beside it, so the two cannot drift apart —
there is no reading of "a naming guess, confidence 0.95" worth being able to
express. `GET /assets/{id}` returns the pair, because the value alone cannot be
argued with: "CRITICAL" invites the question "says who", and the answer used to
exist nowhere.

**A declaration is a floor, not an override.** "This subscription is production"
is a statement about everything in it, so nothing inside it scores below what
was declared — but an asset carrying its own `criticality=critical` tag is the
more specific of the two facts, and lowering it to the subscription's level
would discard the better one. So the higher value wins and the declaration wins
ties. The consequence is the property that makes this safe to hand a customer:
nothing declared can make an asset look *safer* than the capture already showed,
so the worst a mistaken declaration does is over-rank something.

Environment is the exception to the floor, because a name has no maximum: a
person naming it beats a substring match on a resource name every time. That is
the case the feature exists for — the customer whose production runs in a
subscription called `sandbox-eu`.

**Declarations are a table, not columns on `cloud_accounts`.** A discovered
subscription records what Azure said and discovery runs again; a declaration
records what a person said, and mixing the two into one row would make them
untellable apart. The table also carries who declared it and why, because "who
says this is production" is a question people ask of the label rather than of
the audit log. The worker's RLS arm grants SELECT only: a background job that
could write a declaration would be CloudGuard putting words in the customer's
mouth.

**Not done, deliberately.** Per-resource declarations are the obvious next ask
and are a later migration rather than a nullable column nothing writes. And a
declaration does not rescore stored findings on the spot — a risk score is what
a scan concluded, and rewriting one from an API call would leave findings
carrying numbers no observation ever produced.

## 18. A claimed fix is verified on a backoff, and not-verified has three answers

**Spec:** `ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md` §12 item 12 — "a verification engine:
expected-state records, targeted plans, backoff for eventual consistency, and
`INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE` as an outcome distinct from `STILL_FAILING`".

Marking a task done recorded a timestamp and told the customer to run a scan.
If they did, and if that scan happened to produce a PASS on the same rule and
asset, the finding resolved. Every part of that is a coincidence: nothing
recorded what CloudGuard was expecting to see, nothing looked again on its own,
and every way of *not* being verified came out as the same silence — the finding
stayed open and the customer was told nothing.

`remediation_verifications` holds the expectation, written when the claim is
made: this rule, on this asset, should now PASS. Every scan that reaches a
verdict on that pair settles it or spends one attempt — every scan, not only one
started to verify something, because a nightly scan that passes the rule a
customer fixed this morning has answered their question and making them wait for
a scan with the right label on it would be ceremony.

**The backoff is about the cloud, not about load.** Azure applies a change to
its control plane before every read path agrees about it, so a check run a
minute after the work reads the old state and is right to — the environment
genuinely still said that when it was asked. Four attempts over roughly five
hours (5m, 15m, 1h, 4h), then an answer. It stops rather than retrying
indefinitely because an answer is the product: a verification that never settles
is the same silence this table was built to remove, dressed up as diligence.

**Three outcomes, because "not verified" is three different pieces of news.**
STILL_FAILING is CloudGuard looking and disagreeing. INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE is
CloudGuard failing to look — its own problem to explain, not the customer's to
fix. That is exactly the FAIL/UNKNOWN line the rule algebra already draws,
carried up to the one screen where somebody is told whether their work counted.
Telling a customer who has done the work that their fix failed, when the
evidence never arrived, is the same overclaim as a PASS nobody earned, pointed
at the person instead of the environment. A verification that once saw a
definite FAIL settles as STILL_FAILING even if later attempts went blind: having
seen the check fail is the stronger and truer statement.

**A scan settles only what it read.** Spending an attempt on a subscription the
scan never opened would burn the customer's answer on a reading that never
looked at their fix. A pending verification the scan reached no verdict on
*does* count as an attempt, recorded as UNKNOWN — the scan covered the scope and
said nothing about that asset, usually because the asset is no longer there, and
without that a verification whose asset vanished would stay pending for ever
with the scheduler starting scans to settle it.

**Not done:** targeted collection. A verification scan could collect only the
evidence its rule needs — the planner (§16) is the seam for it — but a scan
narrowed that way must also evaluate only what it collected fresh, or it would
re-assert stale verdicts about every rule it did not look at. That is a rule
about what a narrowed scan may conclude, not a planning decision, and it is the
next thing here rather than part of this.

## 19. Privilege escalation is read from role definitions, never from role names

**Spec:** `ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md` §12 item 15 — the second correlation
template, which "needs edges the graph does not yet have".

The edge is `CAN_GRANT_ROLES`, drawn beside `GRANTS_ROLE` rather than instead of
it: they are different claims about the same pair of nodes, one saying what a
principal may do today and the other that the ceiling is whatever it decides to
give itself.

Whether to draw it is decided by the role *definition*, and that is the entire
difficulty of this feature. **Owner and Contributor both carry
`actions: ["*"]`.** The only thing separating them is that Contributor excludes
`Microsoft.Authorization/*/Write` in its `notActions`. A check that matched role
names, or that read `actions` without honouring the exclusions, would report
every Contributor assignment in existence as a privilege escalation path — one
false alarm per subscription, on the feature whose whole value is that it finds
the thing no rule can. Reading the definition also catches what a name list
never could: a tenant's own custom role granting exactly that one action, which
is precisely the case worth finding.

Matching is segment-wise and case-insensitive, because ARM patterns are
(`Microsoft.Authorization/*`, `*/read`) and Azure's own definitions mix `/Write`
and `/write` freely.

**A chain ends at the scope, not at the identity.** The scope is the size of the
answer — naming the subscription an identity could take over is what turns an
alarm into something someone can act on. And a chain requires an entry point: a
directory administrator who can hand out roles is over-privileged, not a chain,
and reporting one would invent the half of the story that makes it urgent.

**Unmonitored critical assets stay unbuilt, with a reason.** The third template
the review lists is one finding (missing diagnostic settings) on one asset whose
criticality the finding formula already multiplies by. A scenario for it would
be a second opinion on a single finding rather than several findings seen as one
thing — the same double-count §16 avoids by keeping scenario risks out of the
security score. It earns a template when it spans several assets; as one rule on
one asset, the risk score already says it.

The fixture changed with this: `snapshot_mixed.json` described a role called
Contributor carrying Owner's permissions, which was never a real Azure role. It
now carries the real exclusions, so the fixture proves the distinction rather
than sidestepping it.

## 20. History is a feed of transitions, never a log of having looked

**Spec:** `ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md` §2.10 and §12 item 18 — the temporal model.

Three tables, and one rule that shapes all of them: a scan that finds nothing
different writes nothing. The alternative -- a row per scan per asset -- is
easier to write and produces a feed whose signal falls as the customer scans
more often, which is backwards.

**Asset changes are five things, not everything.** An asset appearing or
disappearing, and a change to exposure, sensitivity or criticality -- the three
values the risk engine multiplies a finding by. Diffing whole provider payloads
would be a change feed nobody can read, and the drift that matters is already a
finding.

**Disappearance is a transition, so it needed a column.**
`cloud_resources.absent_since` is set when a scan that covered an asset's scope
does not find it, and cleared when it returns. Derived from `last_seen_at`
instead, an absence would need a scan cadence nobody records, and would
re-report itself on every scan for ever. The row is never deleted: a finding
about the asset is still history worth keeping, and something that vanishes for
a week and comes back is one asset with two events rather than two assets.

**A finding's timeline sits beside the audit log, not instead of it.** They
answer different questions for different readers: the audit log is "what has
anybody in this organization done", for a security reviewer; the timeline is
"what happened to this finding", for whoever is looking at it. Only the second
can be complete, because only it holds the transitions a *scan* made, which no
person did -- and that distinction is the point, since a scan observing a check
pass is verification while a person moving a status is a decision.

**A superseded replay writes no history at all.** It re-evaluates an old capture
and makes no observation, so it records neither changes nor events, exactly as
it records no risk history and resolves no findings.

## 21. Remediation is declared once and the artifacts are generated from it

**Spec:** `ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md` §12 item 20 — "`expected_state` and
`verification_spec` beside the human text, with IaC and Policy snippets
generated from the same declaration that generates the RBAC artifact".

The prose stays. `SecurityRule.remediation` is what somebody reads at two in the
morning and it is snapshot-copied onto every finding, so an old finding keeps
the guidance it was raised with. What is new is the half a machine can act on.

**One setting has three names, so the declaration carries three.** The
normalized field the rule reads, the ARM alias a policy matches on, and the
Terraform argument that sets it — and often three values too: ARM says
`publicNetworkAccess: "Disabled"` where the provider says
`public_network_access_enabled = false`. Emitting the ARM spelling into HCL
would produce a line that does not mean what it says.

**The test runs in both directions**, exactly as the RBAC ones do. An asset
built from a rule's own declaration must make that rule PASS; one violating it
must make it FAIL. Without the second half the declaration is documentation, and
documentation drifts — a rule whose check moved on while its remediation stayed
put tells a customer to change something that no longer closes the finding.

**A policy is generated only where it can enforce the whole rule.** One covering
half of it would pass an asset that still fails, and a customer who deployed it
would believe the class was closed. Where no policy can exist — a directory
setting, a condition over a child collection — the API says so rather than
emitting a definition that deploys and checks nothing, which is the same
discipline `rbac.py` records for permission strings nobody verified: an alias
that looks plausible and is not real fails the customer's deployment outright.

**`also_accepts` exists because floors are not equalities.** A rule accepting
TLS 1.2 or higher, expressed as a policy pinned to 1.2, refuses an account
configured better than asked. That is a change-control incident rather than a
bug report, so the accepted set is declared rather than discovered after
deployment.

The generator negates the expected state, because a policy matches what it
refuses. Doing that by hand per rule is how one ends up denying every compliant
resource, which is why it is computed in one place.

**The vocabulary is three comparisons, and stops there.** `EQUALS` for a
setting, `NONE_MATCHING` and `NOT_EMPTY` for the collections most rules actually
judge. That covers eight of the ten rules; anything beyond it stays undeclared
rather than half-declared, because a remediation that describes most of a check
is worse than one that describes none — the customer satisfies what they were
shown and the finding stays open. A collection expectation carries a witness,
which is both the clearest way to say what is being looked for and what lets a
test build the asset a rule must fail.

**An empty expectation has to say why.** Two rules genuinely have none: one
judges a ratio across the directory, the other a relationship between a machine
and the security groups governing it. But an empty declaration is also what a
rule looks like when nobody could be bothered, and those must not be
indistinguishable — so a test requires an empty one to carry a reason and
something the customer can still run.

## 22. The customer wires up change events, because CloudGuard cannot

**Spec:** `ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md` §12 item 19 — "change-triggered scans via
Azure Event Grid".

The whole design falls out of one refusal. Creating an Event Grid subscription
is a **write** in the customer's tenant. CloudGuard holds no write permission
anywhere, that is the strongest security claim it makes, and it is not one to
spend on saving a customer a copy-paste. So CloudGuard generates the command —
one per subscription, because that is how Event Grid is scoped — and the
customer runs it, exactly as they deploy the scanner role.

**The webhook is reachable by anyone**, so the signed token is the whole guard.
It is the same HMAC scheme the ARM template endpoint uses and is separated from
it by `purpose` alone, which is why the webhook checks that field rather than
treating a valid signature as proof of intent. Every rejection returns the same
400 whether the token is malformed, expired, or signed for another connection:
distinguishing them would let a caller enumerate connection ids.

**It answers 200 to what it drops.** Event Grid retries a non-2xx for hours, and
redelivering an event CloudGuard has already decided it cannot act on is load
with no possible outcome. The validation handshake is answered before any
database work and for a connection that need not exist yet, because that
exchange happens at the moment the customer is watching their `az eventgrid`
command.

**Three things stand between an event and a scan**, and without them the feature
is a denial of service against the customer's own API limits, paid for by them.
Events outside the resource providers a rule reads are dropped. A burst marks
the connection and the scan waits for quiet, so one deployment is one reading
rather than forty. And a connection is not scanned for a change more often than
a floor, so an afternoon of deployments is not an afternoon of scans — the same
storm arriving more slowly.

**The webhook only records.** Event Grid times the response; starting a scan
behind it would put a queue, a database write and a provider call between Azure
and its acknowledgement. The sweep that acts on a settled burst is a beat task,
using the same advisory lock and in-flight check every other scan trigger uses.

Turning the feature off closes the webhook immediately, before the customer has
deleted anything in Azure — their subscription keeps delivering to an endpoint
that now refuses it. That is the right way round: a switch that appears to stop
something and does not is worse than one that leaves a tidy-up to do.

## 23. The provider seam is tested, not asserted

**Spec:** `MULTI_CLOUD.md` §8, and the claim in `ARCHITECTURE.md` §6 that
everything above `CloudConnector` is provider-neutral.

That claim was false in three places, and each was invisible to every test of
behaviour because with one provider they all give the right answer:

* the scan pipeline imported Azure's evidence-key enum to ask which keys a
  permission category holds, so a second connector's categories would have
  degraded no rules at all;
* the permissions endpoint returned Azure's grants for every provider, so the
  first AWS customer would have been told CloudGuard wanted Entra admin consent;
* the change-event service hard-coded ARM operation names and the `az` command.

All three now ask the connector or the registry. `get_connector_class` answers
the questions that are properties of a *provider* rather than of a connection to
one, so nothing needs credentials to ask what permissions a cloud wants.
`get_change_feed` does the same for change events, which arrive before any
connection has been resolved.

**`sign_state` moved to `app/core/signing.py`.** Nothing in it was ever Azure —
it signs a dictionary — and it lived under `connectors/azure/auth.py` only
because that is where the consent round trip needed it first. Three unrelated
flows now use it, and the next provider's onboarding would have imported Azure's
package to get a HMAC.

**One exception is scheduled rather than accidental.**
`services/cloud_connections.py` still imports Azure's auth, client and RBAC
modules, and `MULTI_CLOUD.md` §8 step 5 deliberately puts that split *after* a
second connector exists: it is a refactor whose right shape is knowable from two
examples and guessable from one. It is named in the test, so it stays one known
exception rather than becoming a habit — a new leak appears in the failure
message beside it.

**The test looks at imports, not text.** A docstring naming Azure is fine and
unavoidable; an import is what makes neutral code depend on one cloud, and what
a second connector would have to break.

## 24. shadcn/ui is now the primitive foundation (supersedes §12)

**Spec:** none. A frontend brief asked for shadcn/ui as the component
foundation, and §12 required a written decision before that swap — this is it.

§12's reasoning was that a handful of badges, cards and buttons did not justify
a runtime primitive dependency, and for those it was right. What it did not
survive is the second half of the product: a findings table with filters, a
remediation panel with tabs, an organization switcher, a mobile navigation
drawer, a command palette. Every one of those is a focus trap, an escape
handler and a set of ARIA relationships, and hand-writing them is how a security
product ends up with a dialog that keyboard users cannot leave.

So the primitives are now `@base-ui/react` through shadcn's registry, vendored
as source under `src/components/ui/`. Base UI rather than Radix because it is
what the current CLI installs by default; the distinction §12 drew — source, not
a runtime black box — still holds, and these files are editable and reviewed
like any other.

**The severity scale stays separate, and that is the load-bearing part.**
shadcn's tokens are chrome — `primary`, `destructive`, `muted`. CloudGuard's are
meaning: `destructive` says "this button deletes something" and `critical` says
"an attacker can reach your data", and a design system that collapsed the two
would eventually paint a cancel button and a public storage account the same
colour. `tailwind.config.js` therefore carries both layers, and
`SeverityBadge` is deliberately *not* shadcn's `Badge`.

UNKNOWN keeps its dashed border and gains an icon. Colour alone would hide the
product's most important distinction — "we could not look" versus "we looked and
it was fine" — from a reader who cannot separate the hues.

**The compatibility seam is gone.** `components/ui.tsx` was written to let ~20
call sites keep passing `title`/`subtitle`/`action` to a card while the
primitives underneath changed. Every one of them has since moved to the composed
API, so the file was deleted rather than left as a second way to build the same
card. `StatusPill` moved out first: it is security vocabulary, not chrome --
RESOLVED means *a scan observed the fix* -- and it now sits in
`components/security/` beside `SeverityBadge`, which is where a reader would
look for it.

**One thing the CLI got wrong, worth recording.** `init` writes Tailwind v4 CSS
(`@theme inline`, `@import "shadcn/tailwind.css"`) and leaves a v3
`tailwind.config.js` untouched, so every `bg-background` referred to a class
that did not exist and the build failed outright. The v3 bridge in
`tailwind.config.js` is hand-written, and maps `var(--x)` directly rather than
through `hsl()` — the variables hold complete oklch colours, and the usual v3
`hsl(var(--x))` recipe would silently render every one of them black.

## 25. The theme is applied before React exists, and "system" is a real choice

**Spec:** none. The dark palette had been defined since §24 — every neutral
token and a re-lit severity scale under `.dark` — with nothing in the product
able to put that class on the document.

Three decisions worth recording.

**Three states, not a switch.** `light`, `dark` and `system` are stored as
given, because "system" is a standing instruction rather than a synonym for
whichever theme the machine happened to prefer at the moment of choosing. A
laptop that goes dark in the evening takes CloudGuard with it, and a boolean
could only ever record one day's answer. The store subscribes to
`prefers-color-scheme` and follows it only while the choice is `system` — an
explicit choice is not a default for the OS to overrule.

**The class is set by an inline script in `index.html`, before the bundle
loads.** React cannot do this: by the time it mounts the browser has painted a
white page, and correcting it afterwards is a flash of white in a dark room —
which for a console people sit in front of at 2am during an incident is worse
than having no dark mode. That script is the one place in the frontend that
duplicates a constant (`cloudguard-theme`, and the `dark` class), so
`lib/__tests__/theme.test.ts` reads the real `index.html` and fails if the two
copies ever drift.

**`next-themes` is gone.** It arrived as a dependency of the vendored `sonner`
component, which nothing mounts. Two theme stores writing one class to one
element is how a toast ends up light on a dark page, so `sonner.tsx` reads
`lib/theme.ts` like everything else and the dependency was removed.

The severity scale is re-lit rather than reused across the two surfaces, for
the reason §24 gives: a light severity background on a dark page glows, and a
glowing badge reads as more urgent than the one beside it — a ranking the rules
never made.

**A React 18 bug this surfaced.** `Button` came from the registry without
`forwardRef`, which is correct for React 19 where a ref is an ordinary prop.
This app is on React 18, so every Base UI trigger rendering a Button
(`render={<Button />}`) handed a ref to a plain function component: React warned,
and the element the popup anchors to was never captured. `Button` now forwards
its ref, which fixes the existing `Sheet` trigger as well as the new menu.

## 26. The command palette searches what can actually be searched

**Spec:** none. `cmdk` was installed with the shadcn primitives and nothing
used it.

The palette (`components/layout/CommandPalette.tsx`, Cmd/Ctrl-K) jumps to any
page, any asset by name, and any rule. Three decisions are worth recording
because each one is a limit rather than a feature.

**Findings are not searched from the palette, and it says so.** At the time it
was built `GET /findings` had no text search; §27 has since added one, and the
palette could now use it. It still does not, because the rows it would return
are the same rows the findings page ranks and filters properly -- the palette
is for jumping to a *thing*, and a finding is reached through its rule
(`/findings?rule_id=`) or its asset. What the palette must never do is the
option that was rejected outright: filtering the loaded page in the browser,
which would search a hundred findings out of thousands and report "nothing
matches" for the rest. The empty state names what was searched rather than
implying everything was.

**One authority over what matched.** `shouldFilter={false}`: assets are matched
by the API (`name ILIKE %search%`) and everything else by the same substring
rule in this file. Leaving cmdk's fuzzy scoring on top would let it re-rank and
sometimes drop rows the server had already decided matched.

**No mutations in it.** No "run a scan" entry, though it would be easy: every
row is one keystroke from being triggered by whatever happens to be
highlighted, and a scan reads a customer's entire environment. Actions with a
cost stay behind a button somebody meant to press.

Pages come from `NAV_GROUPS`, the same source the sidebar renders, so the two
cannot drift; a test asserts every navigable page appears.

## 27. Searching and ordering belong to the database once a list paginates

**Spec:** none. Two pages had the same silent bug and it was worth naming
rather than just fixing.

`GET /findings` and `GET /risks` both paginate and both report a `total`. The
findings and risks pages asked for neither `limit` nor `offset`, took the API's
default hundred rows, and rendered them as the whole set -- so a tenant with
four hundred findings saw a hundred with nothing on screen saying so.

That alone is a display bug. What made it a correctness one is what the pages
then did with those rows: the findings page searched and sorted them **in the
browser**. Search over one page of an estate answers "no findings match" for
data that was never in the browser to match against, and a client-side "worst
first" puts the CRITICAL on page four below the LOW on page one. In a product
whose entire claim is *we tell you what matters*, both are wrong answers rather
than missing features.

So `search` and `sort` moved into the endpoints (`docs/API.md`), the pages
paginate against the real `total`, and a filter change resets to page one
because page four of the old result describes nothing in the new one. An
unrecognised `sort` is a 422 rather than a silent fallback: quietly ordering a
list differently than asked is the same class of lie in a smaller font.

`sort=severity` is a SQL `CASE` over the severity ranking rather than a column
sort, because alphabetically CRITICAL comes before HIGH but LOW comes before
MEDIUM -- an ordering that looks plausible enough on screen to be believed.

The risks page also gained the filters it had never had (level, status, kind,
and a search), all of them server-side. UNKNOWN is offered as a risk level
because the engine genuinely assigns it, and leaving it out of the filter would
hide precisely the risks CloudGuard could not score. Findings and routes stay in
one ranking by default, per §14: a route outranking the findings inside it is
only visible where they are listed together.

## 28. Connect and Scans are split by what each part fetches

**Spec:** none. `Connect.tsx` was 749 lines and `Scans.tsx` 593.

Length alone would not have justified the change. What did is that both files
mixed several independent request lifetimes, and reading either one made it
genuinely hard to see which request fired when: the scan list polls every two
seconds while anything is in flight, a running scan's card polls a second
endpoint every three, and the panels underneath -- stages, what was collected,
how many findings a delete would purge -- each fetch only when opened. Those are
four different answers to "when does this run", and they were interleaved down
one file.

So the split follows the fetching rather than the layout. `components/scans/`
now holds `ScanCard` (the two live polls), `ScanDetailPanel` and
`CollectionPanel` (open-only), and `DeleteScanConfirm` (which reads the purge
count). `components/connections/` holds `ConnectionCard` (polls until the
connection can actually be scanned), `ScheduleControl` and `RemoveConfirm`. Each
page is now a list, a control and the states around them: 125 and 105 lines.

`IN_FLIGHT` lives in its own module because both the page and the card decide
things from it, and a constant exported beside a component switches off fast
refresh for that file.

**Two behavioural notes from the move.** The schedule dropdown is now a Base UI
`Select`, whose options live in a portal that is not mounted while the control
is closed -- so the trigger renders its label from the value rather than
delegating, or an interval the list does not offer would show as a bare number.
And the connection's status ticks gained icons: three signals distinguished only
by green-versus-grey are three signals a colour-blind reader cannot tell apart.

`@testing-library/user-event` is now a dev dependency. The Base UI listbox is
built out of pointer events and `fireEvent.click` never reaches an option, so
the schedule tests were asserting against a control they could not actually
operate.

---

## 29. The remediation queue joins the finding in the browser

**Spec:** none. `UI.md` section 3 describes the queue; nothing said what a row
had to contain.

`GET /remediation` returns the task and nothing of the finding behind it -- no
title, no rule, no asset -- so every row said the same three things: a priority
badge, a status, and a link reading "View finding". Everything on the card was
about the record and nothing was about the problem, and a person deciding what
to work on next had to open each one to find out what it was.

The finding is therefore fetched per task in the browser, under the same
`["finding", id]` cache key its own page uses, so opening a row from the queue
costs no request at all. That is a round trip per task rather than a join, which
is the right trade at this size: the queue is bounded by work a human created,
and the alternative -- widening the endpoint's response -- is a change to a
stable API for a display concern. It stops being the right trade if the queue
ever grows into the hundreds, and at that point the serializer should carry a
finding summary.

`RemediationOut` is otherwise unchanged, and the API note the endpoint returns
when work is marked done is now shown rather than discarded: marking a task done
never closes a finding, and the sentence saying CloudGuard will look again is
the whole reason that is not a broken promise.

## 30. Actions that do not navigate say so in a toast

**Spec:** none.

Three actions on the finding page and one in the remediation queue changed a
record without moving the reader anywhere, and two of them said nothing at all
-- marking a finding in progress and accepting a risk both wrote to the audit
log and left an unchanged screen. `sonner` was already vendored as
`components/ui/sonner.tsx` and never mounted.

Toasts are used for exactly this: the outcome of an action that has no page of
its own. What stays inline is anything a reader must be able to re-read later --
a failed report generation, an expired session, the verified-fixed banner --
because a message that disappears after four seconds is not where a security
product puts a fact somebody may need to act on.

---

## 31. A navigation styled as a button is a link, not a button

**Spec:** none.

Fourteen places dressed a route change as a button by handing Base UI's
`Button` a `render={<Link />}`. Base UI warned on every one of them, and the
warning was right for a reason that matters: it renders with `nativeButton`
true, which asserts native button semantics over an element that has none.

The tempting central fix -- defaulting `nativeButton` to false whenever a
`render` is passed -- is wrong, and the tests caught it. Base UI then gives the
element `role="button"`, so an anchor announces itself as a button to a screen
reader and loses what a link is actually for: middle-click, ctrl-click, "open
in new tab", and the status bar showing where it goes.

So these render a real `Link` wearing the button's classes --
`className={buttonVariants({ variant, size })}`, wrapped in `cn()` when there
is anything to merge -- which is shadcn's own recipe for this case. `Button` is
kept for things that act rather than navigate. The rule is worth stating because
the wrong version reads as more idiomatic: *if it changes the URL it is a
`Link`, whatever it looks like.*

---

## 32. A report can leave things out, but not the terms it is read on

**Spec:** `UI.md` section 3 described two fixed documents. A frontend brief
asked for period, scope and section options.

**Sections and a window, yes.** `GET /reports/{kind}` now takes `days` (the
activity window: verified fixes, completed work, and how much of the trend line
is drawn) and `sections` (a comma-separated subset of top risks, attack paths,
compliance, remediation, findings). Two of those sections are new content
rather than new switches: the report can now carry the shortest attack paths
with the link worth cutting, and remediation progress with work *claimed* and
fixes *proved* side by side and never summed.

Three rules hold the shape:

* **The posture block and the evidence caveats are not optional.** Coverage,
  staleness and collection failures are the terms every number in the document
  is read on. A report that could drop "12% of checks reached no verdict" would
  let somebody produce a cleaner-looking PDF by unticking a box, which is the
  same transformation — "we could not look" into "we looked and it was fine" —
  that this product refuses everywhere else.
* **What was left out is printed on the cover.** Once a PDF has been forwarded
  twice, an omission somebody chose looks exactly like an absence of evidence,
  and only one of those is true.
* **An absent `sections` means all of them; an empty one means none.** The two
  are distinguished rather than collapsed, because collapsing them would make
  the emptiest request produce the fullest document. An unknown section name is
  a 422 rather than a silent omission.

**The window does not touch the posture, and that is deliberate.** A score, the
open findings and the severity split are a reading of *now*. Giving them a date
range would invite "our score over the last quarter", which no scan can answer
and which this product does not measure. What the window legitimately bounds is
activity — fixes verified, work completed — and the trend, which is cut to the
window rather than resampled: every point is a reading that happened.

**Scope is not offered, and the reason is not effort.** A per-subscription
report would have to recompute the score, the coverage ratio and the freshness
for that scope; anything less produces a document whose headline is estate-wide
and whose list is one subscription, which is the most quietly misleading report
this product could print. It stays out until the posture itself can be scoped.

---

## 33. A finding says what it is part of, from its own endpoint

**Spec:** `UI.md` section 3 listed what a finding detail must answer. Nothing
there said whether the finding was one fault or one link in a route.

The graph has been able to answer this since attack paths were built, and the
finding page could not ask: `ResourceSummary` carries the database id and the
routes are keyed by provider resource id, so the browser had nothing to match
on. The gap was real rather than cosmetic — the findings list ranks problems
one at a time, and a medium misconfiguration on a host standing between the
internet and customer data is not a medium problem.

`GET /findings/{id}/attack-paths` answers it. Three choices in that shape:

* **Its own endpoint, not a field on the finding.** It costs a graph build, and
  the page that answers "what is wrong" must not wait on one. The panel is
  fetched after the page renders; a finding with no asset never asks at all.
* **Membership is asked of the whole route.** A misconfiguration on the jump
  box at the start and one on the storage account at the end are the same
  problem seen from two ends. The response says which by way of `asset_role`
  (`ENTRY`/`STEP`/`TARGET`), because that is what decides the action.
* **An empty answer is not an all-clear, and does not read as one.** What counts
  as sensitive is declared per subscription, so an estate that has classified
  nothing yields no routes. The panel says that in as many words rather than
  printing a reassuring dash.

`serialize_path` moved from the attack-paths route into `services/graph.py`,
because two endpoints now render the same object and a second copy of that
serializer is how two screens start disagreeing about one route.

---

## 34. The asset hierarchy is counted server-side, or it is a lie

**Spec:** `UI.md` section 3 described a filterable inventory. A frontend brief
asked for the subscription → resource group → resource tree.

The page already grouped by resource group, in the browser, over the fifty rows
it had. That is fine as a visual aid to one page and wrong as a hierarchy: a
resource group whose assets straddled two pages appeared twice, each time
holding a fraction of its findings — and the number a reader takes away from a
tree is exactly the count it puts beside a group's name.

So `GET /assets/hierarchy` aggregates over the whole estate in one query and
returns it whole. The tree it feeds is a summary, not a page of rows; the list
keeps paging, and the two are offered as two readings of one inventory rather
than as one replacing the other. Expanding a group asks `/assets` for that
group, so no level of the tree is ever assembled out of something it only
partly has.

**The resource group is read, not stored.** An ARM id spells out its own
subscription and resource group, so the fifth segment *is* the group —
`split_part(provider_resource_id, '/', 5)`, positional because ARM treats
`/resourcegroups/` and `/resourceGroups/` as the same path, and guarded by an
`ILIKE '/subscriptions/%'` so a directory principal's id is never sliced into
an invented group. The backend derives containment the same way when it builds
the asset graph, so the tree and the graph agree by construction.

**A directory asset is not an asset with an unknown subscription.** Users and
service principals belong to the tenant, which outlives every subscription
under it, so they are a named scope of their own. For the same reason, assets
sitting directly in a subscription are labelled as that rather than as
"Ungrouped", which would read as somebody's tagging oversight instead of as
where they actually are.

---

## 35. Tailwind v4, because the primitives were already written in it

**Spec:** none. §24 adopted shadcn/ui through the CLI and recorded that the CLI
wrote v4 CSS against a v3 config, patched at the time with a hand-written
bridge in `tailwind.config.js`.

The bridge was not enough, and the way it failed is the point: **v3 does not
error on v4 syntax, it emits nothing.** Four constructs in the vendored
components compiled to empty:

* `p-(--card-spacing)`, `w-(--anchor-width)`, `origin-(--transform-origin)` —
  the parenthesis shorthand. Cards lost every scrap of internal padding;
  popovers, selects and tooltips lost their anchor sizing.
* `[--card-spacing:--spacing(4)]` — emitted the literal `var(--spacing(4))`,
  which is not a value, so the variable was never set either.
* `in-data-[...]`, `@container/...` — dropped variants.
* `ring-foreground/10` — an opacity modifier against an oklch `var()` colour,
  which v3 cannot compute. **This is the one that was visible from across the
  room.** The class was dropped while the `ring-1` beside it survived, so every
  card, dropdown and tooltip fell back to Tailwind's default ring colour —
  blue — and the whole dark theme was outlined in it.

So the app is on v4, which is what the components were written for. The theme
moved into `src/index.css` as `@theme inline` and `tailwind.config.js` is
deleted; `@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *))` keeps the class-based theme
§25 requires, and `* { @apply border-border outline-ring/50 }` now resolves,
which is the recipe §24 had to work around.

**The severity scale keeps its own layer, unchanged.** `--color-critical` and
friends are declared beside the semantic tokens and mapped from the same
`--sev-*` variables, for the reason §24 gave: `destructive` says a button
deletes something and `critical` says an attacker can reach your data.

Autoprefixer is gone — v4 prefixes and inlines `@import` itself.

## 36. A provider's failure is stated once, not once per key it cost

**Spec:** none.

Azure reports collection failures per evidence key, so a single missing admin
consent arrives as three entries carrying the same nine-hundred-character
sentence about ungranted Graph scopes. The dashboard printed the joined string
verbatim, and the coverage card — the place a customer goes to find out what
CloudGuard could not see — became a wall of the same paragraph repeated.

Identical causes are now stated once with the keys they cost named beside them,
and the message is clipped with the rest one click away. Clipped rather than
summarised: this is the text an administrator will paste into a search box, and
a paraphrase of an Azure error is not an Azure error. The splitting is
defensive about the provider's own punctuation — a part that does not look like
`key: message` is joined back onto the one before it, because a message cut in
half on its own semicolon is worse than a long one.

---

## 37. The overview is an argument, not a grid of cards

**Spec:** `UI.md` §1 named the parts of the executive dashboard. It did not say
what order they go in, and order is most of what a dashboard is.

The page now reads top to bottom as one argument, each step the precondition for
the next: where the posture stands and which way it moves; what that number is
made of; how much of the estate the opinion was formed from; what to deal with
and what those faults form *together*; whether any of it is being fixed; what
moved while you were away.

Four choices in that shape are load-bearing:

* **Coverage is third, not last.** A score computed over half an environment is
  a different claim from the same number over all of it. Placed after the risk
  list, the caveat arrives once the reader has already acted.
* **UNKNOWN is in the severity strip**, at the end and labelled "no verdict".
  It is not a fifth severity and never a pass, but a reader tallying what is
  wrong has to see what could not be answered in the same glance rather than
  further down the page.
* **A ranked risk carries the terms it was ranked by.** The list is the
  product's whole argument and used to ask the reader to take it on trust; the
  three context levels are already columns on the risk row, so a rank now reads
  as a reason.
* **Inventory counts are not headline figures.** Assets and resource counts are
  true and answer a different question; every pixel one takes is a pixel not
  spent on what is wrong. They remain on the pages that are about them.

**Three requests, deliberately.** `/dashboard` is a set of database aggregates
and answers quickly. Attack paths cost a graph build and changes are a windowed
feed, so folding them in would make the numbers everybody came for wait on the
two panels nobody scrolls to first. Both fail quietly — a dashboard that cannot
draw its last panel is still a dashboard.

**Two small backend additions, both aggregation only.** `coverage.categories`
(one grouped read of the evidence table) says *which* part of the estate could
not be read, because "identity is unreadable" and "storage is unreadable" call
for different people to fix them. `top_risks[]` gained `kind` and the three
context levels, which were already loaded on the row.

**What was left out for lack of data, rather than invented.** "12 fixed this
week, 3 reopened", per-risk effort and impact estimates, and a recommended-next-
actions list ranked by effort all need numbers the API does not expose today.
The remediation panel therefore reports only what is measured: the verified-fix
rate, verified fixes in the last thirty days, and what is still open — and every
one of those counts an observation rather than somebody's claim to have fixed
something.

`SecurityScore` and `CoverageIndicator` were deleted rather than left beside
their replacements. Two components that render the same fact are how two screens
start disagreeing about it.

---

## 38. Every chart has to earn its form

**Spec:** none. A request for "prettier, with charts" — which is a request to
*show* more, and the way that goes wrong is showing it in shapes that flatter
the data.

Five forms, each chosen by the question rather than by variety:

* **Rings only for a whole divided in two or three.** Coverage — reached a
  verdict versus did not — and finding status. A ring encodes one share well
  and comparison badly, so nothing ranked is ever drawn as one.
* **Severity is a single stacked bar**, not a five-slice pie: lengths on one
  line are compared exactly, angles around a circle are not, and it costs 8px
  of height rather than a panel.
* **Risk bands and framework coverage are bars from a common baseline**, which
  is the form a ranking asks for. Both are plain elements — a list of widths
  does not need a charting runtime, a canvas and a resize observer.
* **The posture trend is an area on a fixed 0–100 axis**, with the score bands
  painted behind it at 8% so the height *means* something without the line
  changing colour as the data does. Every reading is dotted, because the points
  are the moments CloudGuard actually looked and a smooth line between them
  invites belief in measurements that were never taken.
* **The estate treemap is the one place area is the right encoding.** A tree
  names the parts and a table ranks them; neither answers "is my problem
  concentrated or spread out", which decides whether a customer sends one team
  or six. Tint is a *rate* — findings per asset — so a large group is not darker
  merely for being large.

**Sparklines carry the series the payload already had and nothing rendered.**
`history[].findings_by_severity` and `attack_path_count` were in every dashboard
response and shown nowhere; they are now the line under each severity count and
beside the attack-path panel. "One critical" and "one critical, and there were
none last week" are the same number and a different Monday.

**No dual axes anywhere.** Route counts and a 0–100 score share no scale; two
y-axes in one frame let any two shapes be made to look correlated, so the second
series is a sparkline of its own instead.

**Status colours stay reserved.** Severity is a status palette, not a
categorical one: it is never spent on "series 4", and every chart that uses it
also prints the label, so nothing is carried by hue alone.

**Motion is a statement about honesty, not polish.** Numbers count up on mount
and when the value actually changes — never on a poll that returned the same
figure, which would make an untouched page twitch three times a minute. Charts
animate once on mount and not on update. Lists stagger by 30ms and cap at eight
rows, past which it reads as a slow page rather than as arrival.
`prefers-reduced-motion` is honoured globally in `index.css` and again per
component, and it degrades to the *finished* state rather than a slower one.

**One backend addition:** `remediation_activity`, eight weeks of findings
raised, verified fixed, and reopened, read from the transition log. Reopenings
are counted separately and never netted against fixes — a fix that did not hold
happened, and subtracting it would hide the pattern the panel exists to show.

**A chunking trap worth recording.** `DonutLegend` lives in its own module away
from `Donut`. Imported from beside the ring, it dragged Recharts into the
dashboard's own chunk — 15kB became 206kB — and quietly undid the lazy loading
the charts were written for.

---

## 39. A select's trigger renders its own label, everywhere

**Spec:** none. Reported from a screenshot: the changes window read `30`
instead of "Last 30 days".

§28 recorded this once, for the schedule dropdown, and fixed it there: Base UI
keeps a select's options in a portal that is **not mounted while the control is
closed**, so `<SelectValue />` has no item to read a label from and falls back
to the raw value. What that entry did not do was generalise, and every other
filter in the product carried the same bug — severity reading `CRITICAL`, group-
by reading `resource_type`, the report window reading `90`. The machine's word
for the thing, shown to the person.

So the pattern is a component now. `SelectField` takes one list of options and
feeds both the trigger and the menu, which closes the second half of the same
problem: a label that was written twice and updated once. Every select in the
product — sixteen of them across nine files — goes through it, and
`components/ui/select.tsx` is imported by nothing else.

**The worst instance was not a filter.** The scans page picks which
subscription to read, keyed by the account's row id, so closed it displayed a
UUID: an identifier the customer has never seen, cannot recognise and cannot
act on. `ScheduleControl`, which §28 had already fixed by hand, moved onto the
same component rather than staying a second implementation of it.

Three details worth keeping: `id` is forwarded so a `FieldLabel`'s `htmlFor`
still lands on the trigger; an unrecognised value falls back to printing itself
— a stored filter from an older build should look odd rather than make the
control look broken; and `fallbackLabel` overrides that where the value is an
identifier rather than a word, so an unknown subscription reads "Unknown
subscription" and an interval the list does not offer keeps its own "18 h".

## 40. The risks list shows live risks, and the schedule moved to the scans page

**Spec:** none. Three bugs from screenshots, and two of them had the same
shape — a screen showing something the product itself does not believe.

**The risks page listed every risk row ever raised.** A risk outlives the
finding it was scored from: the finding closes, a later scan supersedes it, and
the row stays. Unfiltered, that rendered four identical "Storage account allows
public access" cards, all marked Open, on an estate the dashboard was
simultaneously reporting two open findings for. The two screens disagreed
because only one was applying the product's own definition of live — a finding
risk counts while its finding is open, a scenario counts until the route
closes — so `GET /risks` now applies it by default. Asking for a status by name
still reaches the rest, which is how a resolved risk is looked up rather than
lost.

**The rule is *settled*, not *strict*, and the difference matters.** A risk is
hidden when its findings say it is over, never merely because they fail to say
it is current: a risk linked to no finding at all stays listed. The link table
is the only thing that could vouch for such a row, so its absence is not
evidence the risk has been dealt with — and hiding it would trade four
duplicates for an empty page, which is the worse failure for a security
product. The first version of this filter was strict, and an integration test
that inserts a risk without links caught it.

**Tabs rendered as a vertical strip beside their own panel.** The registry's
classes matched `data-horizontal`, a bare attribute Base UI never writes: it
writes `data-orientation="horizontal"`. So `data-horizontal:flex-col` compiled
to a rule nothing matched, the root stayed a flex row, and the remediation
panel's Steps/CLI tabs stacked into a narrow column. Same family as §35 —
syntax that is silently inert rather than loudly wrong.

**A select whose value is the empty string had no label.** `SelectField` treated
empty as "nothing selected" and fell through to the placeholder, but the
schedule control's "Manual scanning only" *is* the empty value, so that control
rendered blank — which reads as broken rather than as switched off. Options are
consulted first now, empty string included.

**The schedule is a row inside one panel, not a card inside a card.** Moved as
it was, `ScheduleControl` kept its own border and heading inside the new
panel's border and heading, so one setting rendered as two nested boxes both
titled "Automatic scanning". The control now draws only the control; the panel
around it says what it is, once.

**Automatic scanning moved from the connection card to the scans page**, at the
customer's request and for a reason worth recording: the connections page
answers "can CloudGuard see my cloud", a setup question asked once, while the
scans page answers "when was this last read, and when will it be read next" —
and a schedule is the second half of that sentence. A history of runs with no
visible cadence makes the gaps between them look like something that happened
rather than something that was chosen. The connection card keeps a line saying
where the setting went and what it is currently set to: somebody who configured
it there once should be told it moved, not left to conclude it was dropped.

---

## 41. The remediation queue is reachable from the finding

`POST /remediation` shipped with the API and no screen ever called it. The
queue's own empty state told the reader to "assign a finding from its detail
page", and the detail page had no control that did so — the queue could
therefore only ever be empty, and the one screen that ranks work by impact
against effort was unreachable from every screen that produces work.

The control sits under the recommended fix rather than in the row that holds
"Rescan to verify". Tracking work is a statement about who is going to do the
thing written above it; the verify row is where a person asks for proof, and the
two must not blur into one strip where a button recording intent looks like a
button producing evidence. The caption under it says the finding stays open
until a scan observes the fix, because assigning does move the finding to
`IN_PROGRESS` server-side and that status is the closest thing in the product to
a person marking a security problem solved.

Whether a finding is already tracked is read from `GET /remediation` under the
key the queue page itself uses, rather than by widening the finding detail
response. The detail endpoint is on the hot path of the page the product is
really about, and a join added there to decide the label on one button is a cost
paid by every reader who never presses it. Sharing the cache key also means
opening the queue afterwards costs no request. The API refuses a second open
task per finding, so a button offered unconditionally would be one that
sometimes only produced an error: once a task exists the control is replaced by
what is true — that the work is queued, and where.

A cancelled task does not count as tracking. The work was called off, and the
finding can be picked up again. A verified or accepted finding is offered
nothing at all: one has no work left in it and the other is a recorded decision
not to do the work.

---

## 42. Setup is a wizard at its own URL, and the step is derived, not remembered

Connecting Azure leaves this application twice: to Microsoft for admin consent,
and to Azure Portal for the reader role. Each trip returns through a full page
load, so a dialog over the connections list could not survive either one, and a
step number held in React state is gone before the customer comes back. The
wizard therefore lives at `/connections/new` and `/connections/:id/setup`, and
which step it shows is computed from the connection itself
(`lib/connectionStage.ts`): consent is recorded by the callback, read access by
the probe that runs on every read of the connection. That is the only answer
still correct after the tab is closed, or after the consent link is opened by an
administrator on a different machine.

The consent callback now redirects into that URL rather than to the connections
list, on failure as well as on success — the signed state comes back on a denial
too, so a failure knows which connection it belongs to and can be shown against
the step that produced it, beside the button that starts consent again. Only a
state that cannot be verified at all has nothing to return to, and that is the
one case that still lands on the list.

The steps moved out of `ConnectionCard` entirely. A card that carried a consent
button, a deploy button, a discovery retry and a scope list was the largest
component in the product and the first screen a customer ever used, and it read
as four things to do at once when three of them were not yet possible. The card
now states what a half-finished connection is waiting for and links to the step
it stopped on. What genuinely outlives setup — the subscription scope list, and
the discovery retry, since a subscription created next month appears on the next
read — is shared between the card and the wizard as one component rather than
copied.

Handing the consent link to someone else is a first-class branch of the consent
step, not advice in a paragraph. Admin consent needs a Global Administrator and
the person evaluating CloudGuard usually is not one; the step offers the link
together with a sentence explaining what is being approved, because a bare URL
pasted into a chat window is exactly the request an administrator should refuse.
For the same reason every waiting step offers "Finish later" alongside "Cancel
setup": both grants are somebody else's to give, and a flow that can only be
completed or abandoned makes a customer sit on a spinner waiting for a colleague
who is in a meeting.

A stalled deployment names its three causes — propagation, wrong scope, and
Contributor rather than Owner — with the scope one worded for the scope this
connection actually covers. Changing scope is offered there as discard and start
again, because the scope is what both the consent state and the role assignment
were bound to; there is no edit that would leave either of them meaning what
they meant.

---

## 43. The connections page is a table of rows, and each row answers the same four questions

Four connections as four stacked cards answered "how is this one connection
doing" four times, and never answered the question the page is actually opened
for: is every environment being read, and how recently. That is a comparison, so
the shape is a row — connection, status, subscriptions, last read — with
everything needed to *act* behind a disclosure rather than in front of it.

Column labels sit above the rows, but this is not a `<table>`. Every row opens
into a two-column panel, which a table cell cannot hold without colspan
gymnastics or a nested grid inside a cell; on narrow screens the labels are
hidden and each row stacks carrying its own.

The status column does not print the enum. `ACTIVE` is true of a connection with
every subscription unticked, and `PENDING` is true both of one waiting on an
administrator and of one whose deployment failed an hour ago — so `statusSummary`
answers "is CloudGuard reading this environment" in words, with a second line
saying what to do when the answer is no. Last read is derived from the
subscriptions rather than fetched, including ones now out of scope: the question
is when this environment was last looked at, and one excluded yesterday was
still looked at last week. It is rendered as elapsed time, because an absolute
timestamp asks the reader to subtract against a clock they cannot see.

A closed row costs nothing. The list endpoint already carries subscriptions, so
the per-connection request runs only while a row is open — and the polling that
used to justify itself on this page (a card left open was what noticed a
finished deployment) moved with setup into the wizard. `change_events_enabled`
and `last_change_event_at` are serialized onto the connection for the same
reason: the cadence line needs both halves of the answer, and fetching the
second half from the change-events endpoint would be one request per row to
render one line.

Each subscription row carries its own history — first seen, new since last read,
excluded by you and when. `scope_changed_at` (migration 0021) is stamped only
when the flag actually flips, so a screen re-sending rows it displayed cannot
move the date on subscriptions nobody touched. Without it the product could say
*that* a subscription was excluded and never *when*, which is the difference
between a decision somebody made in August and an environment that has been
silently unscanned for as long as anyone can remember. Long estates collapse
behind a count rather than pushing the panels beside them off the screen.

"Scan now" on a row posts one scan naming any scannable subscription beneath the
connection, because a scan is already connection-scoped server-side: the worker
resolves the subscriptions when it runs, so one discovered between queueing and
running is still read.

The empty state states the read-only claim and then proves it: "Read what
CloudGuard will do" fetches `/cloud-accounts/azure/permissions` and lists the
directory permissions, the Azure role and the writes performed. A hardcoded list
would be a second copy of the claim, free to drift from the one Microsoft's
consent screen actually shows. Its four-step preview is the wizard's own
`SETUP_STEPS`, in the same words, so the list cannot drift from the flow it
previews.

---

## 44. The graph holds present assets, and a rule may group its findings into one risk

Two separate corrections to the same habit of counting rows instead of problems.

**`load_graph` reads assets that are still there.** An asset a scan looked for
and did not find keeps its row — `absent_since` is set rather than the row
deleted, so its findings stay history and so an asset that vanishes for a week
and returns is one asset rather than two. The loader was reading every row the
organization had, so `/attack-paths`, the asset detail page and the PDF report
served routes through resources that no longer existed, while the scanner's own
graph, built from one scan's normalized state, never contained them. Two views
of one tenant disagreeing, with the wrong one facing the customer. Edges are
already dropped when either endpoint is missing from the node set, so filtering
the nodes is the whole fix.

Still unfiltered, deliberately: a subscription the customer excludes stops being
scanned, so its assets never become absent and stay in the graph indefinitely.
That wants scope on the query and is a change to what "the organization's graph"
means, not a bug in this one.

**A rule may declare that its findings are one risk.** `AZ-ID-001` fails once
per privileged account without a second factor, and each of those is separately
fixed and separately verified, so the *findings* stay per resource. As forty
risks it was forty rows saying one sentence, and forty Critical deductions —
which pins the org security score at zero over a single Conditional Access
policy that was never written. The remediation the rule itself prints is one
policy covering every privileged role at once.

So `SecurityRule.risk_grouping` declares it, as a `RiskGrouping` carrying the
singular and plural sentences. Declared rather than inferred from the count:
whether repeated failures are one problem or many is a judgement about the
rule's subject. Two storage accounts left public are two mistakes; two
administrators without MFA are one policy nobody wrote.

The group is **scored as its worst member**, exactly as a scenario is — it
cannot be less serious than the worst thing in it, and must not be more serious
either. Its breakdown is that member's, so "why is this 84?" still names
components measured on a real asset rather than an average of forty. What the
group adds is the count, and the count is in the title.

Identity across scans reuses `scenario_key` (`group:<rule_id>`), the column that
already answers "what identifies a risk that is not identified by a single
finding" — so no migration, and the existing unique index on (organization, key)
covers it. Per-finding risks from before a rule grouped are **deleted** when
absorbed, which is the opposite of what happens to a closed route and for the
opposite reason: nothing ended. The same accounts still fail the same check, and
a resolved duplicate would show a customer a fixed MFA risk beside an open one
for the same people. The findings keep every event they ever had.

Two counting rules follow. A group closes only when nothing in it is still open,
or the first administrator to register an authenticator app would close a risk
covering thirty-nine who had not. And the band queries behind the security score
count `distinct` risks, because the junction fans a risk out across its members
— counting join rows would reinstate the forty deductions the grouping exists to
collapse. `open_finding_count` is now taken from the findings, having been the
width of that band query, which was the same number only while every risk had
exactly one member.

---

## 45. The security score decays instead of subtracting

`max(0, 100 - Σ deductions)` was strict, which was right, and clamped, which was
not. Five open Criticals scored 0. Twenty scored 0. So did the same estate after
seven of them had been fixed and verified. The number stopped moving exactly
where a customer needs it to move most — through the months of a remediation
programme — and `score_delta` on the dashboard, computed from it, reported that
nothing had happened. On the product whose north-star metric is verified risk
reduction, the headline number was structurally incapable of showing it.

The same deduction total now drives `round(100 × exp(-Σd / k))`. Every fix moves
the score; the curve is steepest across the first few Criticals, where the
strictness has to live; and 0 is where a catastrophic estate lands rather than
where an ordinarily bad one starts. One Critical leaves 77, five leave 28,
twelve leave 5, thirty leave 0.

**Fitted to an anchor, not to a rate.** `k` is solved for from
`score_anchor_criticals` and `score_anchor_value` — two Criticals leave 60, the
sentence already in `RISK_ENGINE.md` §3 and already asserted in the tests. The
calibration is therefore the thing configured, and it survives somebody retuning
what a Critical costs, rather than silently parting company with the doc.

Two consequences worth stating because neither is obvious:

- Fitting to the anchor **normalizes** the deductions, so their absolute size is
  absorbed and only their ratios to a Critical decide anything. Doubling every
  deduction changes no score at all — which matters because "make everything
  cost more" is the obvious way to attempt a stricter score. The levers are the
  ratios, and the anchor.
- The integer rounding does flatten the curve eventually, around twenty open
  Criticals. That is a real limit and an acceptable one: the score is read
  rather than computed with, and by then it has said what it has to say. Below
  that, every Critical closed is visible.

The band thresholds the UI colours by (`scoreColor`: 85 / 60 / 40) are unchanged
and still land where they should — two Criticals is amber at 60, five is red at
28, where it used to be red at 0 alongside every other broken estate.

---

## 46. The security score charges for context CloudGuard established, not context it guessed at

`RISK_ENGINE.md` §3 has always said coverage is reported beside the score and
not folded into it. Half of that was true. A check that reaches no verdict
raises no finding, so evidence coverage genuinely never reached the number. But
§1 scores an UNKNOWN criticality, sensitivity or exposure at 3.5 — just under
High — and that band drove the deduction. An estate nobody had labelled was
therefore told its posture was worse, on the strength of what CloudGuard could
not work out rather than anything about the customer's risk, on the same
dashboard that promises the opposite.

The cautious 3.5 is not the mistake and has not changed. It is what stops the
cheapest route to a good score being to tag nothing, and an unclassified
production database must never sort below a labelled dev box. The mistake was
using one number for two jobs.

So the scorer produces both. `risk_score` / `risk_level` rank, cautiously, and
still drive the risks list, the top-risks panel and the band distribution.
`known_score` / `known_risk_level` take every UNKNOWN input at the LOW floor —
not zero, because an asset is at least a low-criticality asset — and the org
Security Score deducts on those. For a fully classified asset the two are
identical, so nothing changes for a customer who has done the labelling.

Recomputed rather than discounted: the weights are not uniform, so which
component was unknown changes how much it mattered, and a blanket multiplier
would get that wrong in both directions.

`known_risk_level` is NULL on scenario risks, and NULL means "not computed"
rather than "no risk" — a route is a statement about wiring rather than about an
asset's context, and it never reaches the org score because the findings it
groups already do. The band queries coalesce to `risk_level`, which also leaves
rows written before migration 0022 scoring exactly as they did rather than
being silently re-banded.

**The consequence is a visible one, and it is the point.** Untagged estates
score higher than they did, immediately, without anyone fixing anything. What
replaces the deduction is a sentence the customer can act on: `coverage.context`
counts the open risks sitting on unclassified assets, shown on the dashboard
beside the evidence-coverage ring and printed on the cover of every PDF, with a
link to the subscription context declarations in Settings. Silently deducting
told them nothing and gave them nothing to do.

---

## 47. Exploitability is required, and it is a ceiling rather than a constant

Two defects in one tag, and both of them are shapes this codebase refuses
everywhere else.

**It defaulted to 0.** `exploitability: int = 0` on `SecurityRule` meant a rule
whose author never thought about the question silently asserted the
misconfiguration was unexploitable — an absence reading as safe, which is the
same overclaim as a PASS nobody earned and the exact thing the UNKNOWN/PASS
distinction exists to prevent. It is now declared without a default, like
`severity`: a rule that omits it raises `AttributeError` at import rather than
quietly scoring 0.

**It was flat across instances.** An NSG rule allowing RDP from the whole
internet scored 5 whether it guarded a production jump box or nothing at all —
on the engine whose entire premise is that the same misconfiguration means
different things in different places. The distinction was already computed:
`_attachment_evidence` records whether the group protects anything, AZ-CMP-001's
own description contrasts itself with "an unattached NSG rule", and the note on
`ResourceRelationship` says an unattached NSG allowing RDP is noise. It reached
the evidence and never reached the score.

So `RuleResult` now carries an optional `exploitability`, and the class value
becomes the **worst** instance of that misconfiguration rather than every
instance of it. Three rules step down where they can already tell:

- an NSG rule protecting nothing → 1. Nobody can connect to a machine it does
  not guard, so what is left is a latent mistake, real and worth fixing before
  something is attached to it.
- a storage account open to every network but with anonymous blob access off →
  3. A key or a SAS token is still required, which is an attacker who already
  has a credential rather than one with a browser.
- a database whose only over-broad firewall rule is Azure's `0.0.0.0-0.0.0.0`
  shortcut → 3. Every Azure tenant is a serious and usually unintended gap, and
  it is not the open internet.

**Down only.** `effective_exploitability` clamps to `0..tag`, so a rule can
never claim an instance is worse than its own tuned value. That number is the
starting value `RULE_ENGINE.md` §5 says to tune against real environments; a
rule able to raise it per finding would be retuning itself in the dark, one
finding at a time. A mistaken override can therefore only understate — the
direction that costs a customer nothing the severity has not already told them.

The starting values themselves are unchanged. Retuning them wants the real
environments the doc asks for, and this change is about the mechanism.

The scale is now written down (`RULE_ENGINE.md` §5) in terms of what the
attacker must already have, from "nothing, anonymous, today" at 5 to "weakens
detection rather than enabling anything" at 1. Eleven magic integers with no
stated basis could not be reviewed; 4 versus 5 is now a question with an answer.

`_upsert_risk` reads the exploitability from the scored inputs rather than from
the rule, so the number shown on the detail page is the number the arithmetic
used.

---

## 48. Compensating controls lower a finding's score and never close it

Every path CloudGuard scored was scored as though nothing in the environment
defended it. An administrator with no registered second factor ranked identically
in a tenant where security defaults challenge every sign-in and in one where
nothing does — which is the same flattening the risk engine exists to refuse,
pointed at defences instead of at assets.

A `Control` (`app/rules/controls.py`) is one observed defence and what it leaves
an attacker needing. A rule returns them on its `RuleResult`, and
`effective_exploitability` takes the minimum of the class tag, any instance
step-down and every control — so several compose to the strongest without any of
them knowing the others exist, and none can ever raise a finding.

Three rules, and each is the product refusing a temptation the category is full
of:

**A control never turns FAIL into PASS.** A policy demanding a second factor of
an account that has never registered one locks that account out of its own
tenant at the first challenge — a real operational problem, not a fixed one —
and the policy can be disabled, rescoped or have that account excluded in a
change nobody reviews. Reporting a pass would be CloudGuard vouching for a state
of affairs it is not observing.

**Only prevention counts.** Detection is not compensation. Defender watching a
storage account changes whether somebody finds out, not what an attacker must
have to get in, and the exploitability scale is written in terms of the second
(§47). A control that only shortens time-to-discovery belongs in a report.

**The control must be observed.** Every one is built from the same capture the
finding came from, and one CloudGuard could not fully read is simply absent.
Absence of evidence lowers nothing.

Implemented for AZ-ID-001 from two Graph readings, both under permissions
already in `REQUIRED_GRAPH_PERMISSIONS` and already consented by every connected
tenant — so this costs nobody a second trip to a Global Administrator.
Security defaults are unconditional. Conditional Access is only accepted when
every part of it resolves: enabled rather than report-only; granting MFA
unambiguously, so `MFA or compliantDevice` under `OR` is discarded because a
stolen password still works on an enrolled machine; covering all applications,
since CloudGuard cannot know which one an attacker would use; and with every
group it names read back, because an unread exclusion group could be the one
holding the account being judged. That last case is why the collector reads the
members of exactly the groups a policy mentions — essentially every real tenant
excludes a break-glass group, and without resolving it the feature would be
theatre.

Role template ids are matched through the tenant's own `directoryRoles` rather
than a table of GUIDs written from memory, for the reason `rbac.py` records
about ARM action strings: a wrong identifier is indistinguishable from a right
one by inspection.

Controls are **not** normalized into `resources`. A Conditional Access policy is
not a thing anybody secures, has no exposure and no data sensitivity, and would
inflate every inventory count with rows a customer never asked to own. They ride
on `NormalizedState.controls` and reach rules through `RuleContext.controls`.

The pipeline writes them onto the finding's evidence under
`compensating_controls`, and the detail page renders them above the raw evidence
under "What is standing in the way" — because a score arrived at through a rule
nobody can see is the kind a customer stops trusting. The copy is deliberately
not reassuring.

**Just-in-time VM access is the obvious next one and is deliberately absent.**
It would need `Microsoft.Security/locations/jitNetworkAccessPolicies/read` in
the scanner role, and `rbac.py` requires every action string to be verified with
`az provider operation show` before it ships — an unverified one fails the
customer's entire role deployment atomically, which is exactly how
`autoProvisioningSettings/read` was caught. It would also cost every existing
customer a role redeploy and a `ROLE_VERSION` bump. It goes in when the string
has been checked against a real tenant.

---

## 49. Choke points: the one change, verified rather than counted

The attack-path list ranks routes shortest-first, which is the right order for
reading them and the wrong one for acting. Fifty routes are fifty things to
read. "Remove this one role assignment and thirty-seven of them close" is one
thing to do — and it is frequently not the fix any single route would have
suggested, because each route's own `cheapest_break` is at its start while the
link they all share sits in the middle.

`AssetGraph.choke_points()` is two passes, and the second one is the whole
point. Counting how many routes a link sits on takes a single walk and
**overstates**: a link on twenty routes closes only the ones with no way round.
So the leading candidates by containment are then checked by removing the link
and re-running the entire traversal, comparing which (entry, target) pairs are
still reachable. That is the only way to distinguish a route that is gone from
one that has merely been made longer.

Verified for the top few rather than for every candidate, because each check is
a full re-traversal. Containment is an upper bound on severance, so the ordering
that selects candidates can never skip a link that would sever more than a
checked one.

Both numbers are reported. `severs` is what closes and `on_routes` is what it
sits on, and where they differ the UI says so — a customer told four routes
close who then sees two remain stops believing the next number too. The severed
routes are named as well as counted: a count is a claim, and those are its
working.

`CONTAINS` is never a candidate. A storage account has to live somewhere, so
offering "stop the resource group containing it" is a recommendation nobody can
take — the same reason `Path.cheapest_break` skips it.

Attack paths only, not escalation chains. They answer a different question, and
one count spanning both would make "routes" mean two things in a single
sentence.

Its own endpoint and its own query, fetched only once the page has routes to be
about. It costs a re-traversal per candidate, and the list is read far more often
than the question is asked.

**Not wired into the remediation queue.** A choke point is a change to make and
frequently corresponds to no finding at all — the shared role assignment may be
perfectly ordinary in isolation. Turning one into a queue item would mean
minting work with no finding behind it, which is a decision about what the queue
*is*, not a detail of this analysis.

---

## 50. Every colour is lit for the surface it sits on

The theme had two blocks, light and dark, and the dark one was not a re-lighting
of the light one so much as a partial copy of it. Measuring every pair found
three things wrong, and they are the same mistake in three places: a colour
chosen against one background and then used against another.

**The chart ramp was one greyscale in both blocks.** `--chart-1` through `-5`
ran 0.87 → 0.269 in lightness, which is a ramp built to sit on white. On the
light page the top of it measured 1.48:1 and was invisible; on the dark page the
bottom measured 1.31:1 and was invisible. Each mode now runs from its own
surface outward, every step clearing 3:1 against both the page and the card,
because a chart lives inside a card.

**`bg-ok text-white` measured 1.95:1 in dark.** `--sev-ok` is a light green
there, as it has to be, and white on it is unreadable. The fix is
`text-background` rather than a new token: it is white in light mode and near
black in dark, it was already the idiom two lines away in the same component,
and it cannot drift from the surface because it *is* the surface.

**Two statuses were written in Tailwind palette classes.** `bg-stone-50` and
`bg-white` in `format.ts` do not flip with the theme, so on a dark page the
"not covered" cell — the quietest status in the product — rendered as the
brightest block on the screen. They are separated by fill and a dashed border
now, not by a hardcoded grey.

The chrome moved as little as possible around those: `--muted-foreground` from
4.73:1 to 5.51:1 (it is every secondary line in the product, and it sat close
enough to the AA line that antialiasing decided it), `--ring` from 2.59:1 to
4.28:1 (the focus indicator is `focus-visible:border-ring` at full opacity, so
that value is what WCAG 1.4.11 measures — the `/50` ring beside it is a halo),
and the two severities under 5:1 on their own tint nudged just past it with
their hues untouched.

One thing was removed rather than adjusted: `--sidebar-primary` in dark was
shadcn's default indigo, the only saturated hue in the chrome of either theme.
An accent that appears in one mode and not the other reads as a bug, and in this
product a colour that means nothing sits badly beside a scale where every colour
means something.

**The rule this leaves.** A colour is not correct or incorrect on its own, only
against a surface — so a token defined in one block is not done until it has
been measured in the other, and a component that names a palette colour has
opted out of the theme rather than styled itself.

## 51. Retention keeps the present, whatever the window says

Two things grew without bound and neither had ever been pruned: the raw captures
in `cloud_snapshots`, and the content-addressed payloads in `evidence_blobs`.
Both are the largest rows in the schema and both are kept for real reasons — a
capture is what lets a scan be re-evaluated against improved rules, a payload is
what a citation points at — and neither reason survives indefinitely.

**The newest capture of each scope is never pruned, whatever the window says.**
It is what an *applied* replay reads: replaying the newest snapshots may resolve
findings, while every older one is `evaluation_only` and may not. Pruning it
raises nothing — it turns "did the fix work" into an advisory answer, months
later, on the path the north-star metric runs through. So it is excluded by
construction rather than by choosing a window long enough that it probably will
not happen.

Two scopes, not one. A subscription's resources and the tenant directory read
through a connection are different things, and a tenant-wide replay restores the
directory beside each subscription — pruned out from under it, the identity
rules read nothing while the subscription rules carry on, which is a replay that
half worked.

**Payloads are measured from `last_seen_at`, not `first_stored_at`,** which is
the whole reason that column exists. An estate that has not changed in six
months stores one copy and touches it on every scan; measuring from first
storage would delete the payload behind every current reading, which is
deduplication working against itself.

**And pruning a payload invalidates nothing that cited it.** `finding_evidence`
copies the hash rather than holding a foreign key, so a finding raised last year
still says truthfully what was read, when, and under which permission — the API
reports the payload as unavailable rather than offering a link that fails. That
was designed in §50's neighbourhood before there was anything to prune; this is
the entry that makes use of it.

Evidence *rows* are deliberately not pruned. They are one row per key per
subscription per scan against a payload that is the listing itself, and deleting
the record of what was read to save the size of the record of what was read is
the wrong trade — it is also the trade that makes an old finding unanswerable.

Windows are settings (`snapshot_retention_days` 30, `evidence_retention_days`
90) with defaults rather than required values: a missing one costs disk, not
correctness, which is not the kind of misconfiguration the rest of `config.py`
refuses to boot on.

---

## 52. The asset graph is cached against its data, not against a clock

Six callers build the graph and four are request handlers — the attack-path
list, choke points, blast radius, and a finding's routes. Every one read the
whole tenant, every present asset and every edge, and somebody clicking between
those screens paid for it each time. On the one page where a tenant large enough
to have interesting paths is also large enough to be slow.

**Cached on the version of the data rather than on a TTL.** A time-based cache
would make these pages briefly wrong after every scan, and briefly wrong here
means telling somebody an attacker can still reach their data through a route
they closed this morning. §"the graph holds present assets" already established
that a stale path is not a weaker claim than a real one, it is a false one — a
TTL would reintroduce exactly that, on a timer.

The version is three aggregates: the newest `cloud_resources.updated_at`, the
newest `resource_relationships.created_at`, and the count of present assets. The
count is not redundant. A scan that only *removed* an asset moves no timestamp —
the rows that remain were not touched, and the one that went is not there to
carry a time — so without it the graph would go on serving routes through
something no longer in the estate.

Keyed on the data rather than on "the newest scan", though a scan is the only
thing that rewrites assets today. Keying on the scan would be an inference about
which processes write, and the day something else does — a context declaration
applied in place, a manual edit — the cache goes stale silently.

Bounded at eight tenants, LRU. This is a read cache in a process that serves
every customer, and holding a graph per tenant for the life of the process
trades a latency problem for a memory one whose size is a function of how many
customers happened to open one page.

The scan pipeline does not read it: `_correlate_paths` builds from the
normalized state in hand, so it can neither be served a stale graph nor leave
one behind.

---

## 53. The capture is stored twice, and the gate on stopping

`cloud_snapshots.data` holds a whole capture per scan. The per-key payloads in
`evidence_blobs` hold the same bytes, split by reading and content-addressed.
The difference is that the second is deduplicated and the first is not: a daily
scan of an estate that has not changed writes one payload set and a **fresh full
capture every night**, for as long as retention keeps it.

That is worth fixing by making `cloud_snapshots` a manifest — the keys and
hashes of its readings — and rebuilding the capture from blobs on replay. It is
not worth doing on an assumption, which is why `test_evidence_store.py` has
carried the precondition since evidence was per-key: *replay reads
`cloud_snapshots` and must keep doing so until reconstruction holds against real
scans.*

So the gate ships before the change. `TestCaptureReconstruction` asserts, on a
real pipeline run, that the stored readings rebuild the capture exactly, and
that a second scan of an unchanged estate adds no payloads while adding a whole
capture.

**The case a careless flip gets wrong,** and the reason a unit test was not
enough: a task can produce more than one payload key. `authentication_methods`
has no task of its own — the directory's role-map task reads it — so a
reconstruction keyed by task rather than merged by payload drops it, and the MFA
rule then finds nothing to judge while reporting no error at all.

**Two lifetimes to reconcile before flipping.** Captures are pruned at 30 days
and payloads at 90, and the two are independent today because neither depends on
the other. A manifest makes captures depend on payloads, so `prune_blobs` would
have to refuse any hash a retained manifest still names — otherwise retention
would quietly destroy a capture that is inside its own window.

---

## 54. The capture is a manifest, and retention is now interlocked with it

§53 named the waste and shipped the gate. `TestCaptureReconstruction` passed
against real scans, so the flip: `cloud_snapshots` stores everything the capture
recorded *except* the payloads, plus the content hash of each reading. The
payloads live once in `evidence_blobs`, shared by every scan that read identical
bytes.

`data` is kept and made nullable rather than dropped. Captures written before
this carry their payloads inline and must go on being replayable, so the read
path takes whichever it finds — and dropping a column holding the only copy of
anything is not a migration anybody should be able to run by accident.

**A missing blob is refused, not skipped.** `SnapshotUnavailable` rather than a
partial rebuild: half a capture replays as an estate missing whatever the other
half held, and that replay may resolve findings. A resolution reached by
omission is the same overclaim as a PASS nobody earned, arrived at from a
direction the rule engine cannot see.

**The dependency this created, and the interlock that answers it.** A capture
used to be self-contained. It now points at blobs, so a blob can be the only
copy of part of a capture that is well inside its own window — and the two have
different windows (30 days and 90). `prune_blobs` therefore keeps any hash a
surviving manifest still names, whatever its age says. Without it, retention
would delete nothing visibly and fail months later, at the one moment somebody
replays a capture to check whether a fix held.

Two things the tests had to be corrected about while building this, both the
same mistake in different clothes: a fake matched `payload_hashes` in SQL text,
where it is a bound parameter of the `->` operator and never appears; and a fake
`DELETE` reported no rowcount, so every prune looked like a no-op regardless of
what it named. Each made a test pass by proving the opposite of its name.

**And the column default that made all of this fail in CI.**
`cloud_snapshots.data` was created in 0001 as `jsonb NOT NULL DEFAULT
'{}'::jsonb`. 0027 stopped writing the column and dropped its NOT NULL — and
left the default. So every capture written after the flip came back holding an
empty object rather than NULL, and `_rebuild_capture`, which chose between the
inline and manifest forms by asking whether `data` was NULL, took the inline
branch and rebuilt an estate with nothing in it.

Nothing failed where the mistake was. Collection succeeded, the capture was
stored, the payloads were stored, the manifest was correct — and then every
scan died in ANALYZE with `KeyError: 'provider'` on a capture that was
perfectly good. Sixty integration tests failed, all of them downstream of the
one question asked the wrong way round.

The fix is 0029 and a changed question. The default goes, and the rows already
written that way are set back to NULL — guarded on `manifest IS NOT NULL`,
which names exactly the captures written since 0027 and cannot touch a pre-0027
capture that genuinely held an empty object. And `_rebuild_capture` now decides
the form from the *manifest*, because the manifest is the thing that is present
in one form and absent in the other. A column with a default cannot answer "did
anybody write this", and the general lesson is that a nullable column is only a
reliable "unset" signal once its default is gone too.

**A failed listing that returned nothing used to cost no verdict at all.**
A rule reports UNKNOWN from inside `evaluate`, and `evaluate` runs once per
matching resource. So a rule whose evidence failed to collect had nothing to
iterate over and produced nothing: no verdict, no gap row, and a coverage ratio
computed over the rules that happened to have something to look at. Failing to
look cost less than looking and finding a problem — the same overclaim as a
PASS nobody earned, arrived at through silence rather than through a wrong
answer.

It survived this long because a fixture hid it. The recorded snapshot carried
its storage listing even when the test marked storage as failed, so the rules
had resources to iterate and degraded correctly. A real run has no such
listing, and neither does a capture rebuilt from a manifest, which is why §54
surfaced it.

`RuleEngine._run_per_resource` now records one UNKNOWN when a rule matched
nothing *and* its declared `requires_evidence` names a listing that failed. The
two conditions together are the whole point: no resources plus no error is a
customer who has none of them, which is NOT_APPLICABLE and correctly excluded
from the coverage ratio; no resources plus a failed listing is nobody having
looked. The gap carries no `resource_id`, because there is no asset to
attribute it to — that absence *is* the finding about the scan.

**A request must not commit the transaction it was handed.**
`rls_session` wraps a whole request in `session.begin()` and declares who is
asking with `SET LOCAL ROLE authenticated` and `request.jwt.claims`. Both are
transaction-scoped — which is what stops them leaking to the next checkout of a
pooled connection, and equally means a commit inside a request tears down the
settings every RLS policy reads. `commit_unless_externally_managed` exists for
exactly this, and is a no-op under a session that owns its transaction.

`set_change_events` called `session.commit()` directly, the only one of eleven
writes in that file that did. Turning change detection *off* worked, because
nothing ran afterwards. Turning it *on* did not: the route goes on to build the
Event Grid wiring commands, which reads the connection's subscriptions, and
that read ran as the bare `cloudguard_app` role with no claims.

The guard is now a test over `app/services/`, not over the one function that
had it, with per-function exemptions for the code that opens its own session —
per function rather than per module, because `scans.py` holds both the worker's
reaper and endpoints a request reaches, and exempting the file would exempt
those too.

**And the failure was invisible from the browser, which is the worse half.**
The API registered handlers for `AppError`, `HTTPException` and
`RequestValidationError`, and nothing else. Anything unanticipated escaped to
Starlette's `ServerErrorMiddleware`, which sits *outside* `CORSMiddleware`, so
its 500 carried no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` and the browser refused to
read it. `fetch` then rejected with `TypeError: Failed to fetch` — what a
browser says when a request never arrived at all. So a server-side bug was
indistinguishable from the API being unreachable, and the connections page
reported a network failure for a request that had arrived, run, and raised.

Registering a handler for bare `Exception` does not fix this: Starlette
special-cases that one and hands it to the same outermost layer.
`UnhandledErrorMiddleware` sits inside CORS instead — `main.py` adds it first,
and `add_middleware` inserts at the front, so the last one added is outermost.
The response carries the envelope and a sentence; the stack trace goes to the
log, because rendering one into a browser is a disclosure and this is a
security product.

## 56. Rules are bounded by collectors, not by ambition

The catalogue went from 10 rules to 17, and what decided *which* seven is worth
recording, because the obvious approach produces a worse product.

A CSPM is expected to check key vault configuration, database auditing, disk
encryption, activity logs, credential expiry, vulnerabilities and backups.
CloudGuard collects none of those. A rule for each would have been quick to
write and would have answered UNKNOWN for every customer for ever — a catalogue
that looks complete and says nothing, which is the same overclaim as a PASS
nobody earned wearing different clothes. So the rule set is bounded by the 16
evidence keys that exist, and grows when a collector does.

**The RBAC family needed no new collection, and that is why it went first.**
Role assignments were already read for the graph. What was missing was smaller
and stranger: the normalizer recorded a role's *name* only on principals it
minted, never on directory users, on the stated grounds that a traversal reads
the edges anyway. True of a traversal, false of a rule — an edge says a
principal reaches a scope and cannot say as what. "This named person holds Owner
over your subscription" was therefore a fact CloudGuard collected, drew a line
for, and could not state. Three rules fell out of fixing that one line.

`AZ-IAM-003` reads the role *definition's permissions* rather than its name,
because Owner and Contributor both carry `actions: ["*"]` and only Contributor
excludes the assignment write. A name-based check would flag every Contributor
on nearly every subscription in existence, which is how a whole feature gets
switched off.

**Three guard tests caught omissions in this work, and each was fixed in the
code rather than in the test.** `ROLE_DEFINITIONS` carried a seven-day reuse
window justified by "no rule reads them"; `AZ-IAM-003` made that false, so a
customer editing a custom role to remove escalation and rescanning would have
been answered from last week's catalogue — `_REUSE_WINDOWS` is now empty. Every
rule must carry a machine-readable remediation, and the RBAC rules legitimately
have no expected state, so they take the documented empty form that owes a
reason and a command. And `applies_when` could only express metadata, so
`AZ-DB-002` — whose expectation is about a database *holding sensitive data* —
was handed a synthetic asset it declined to judge, and its round-trip test
passed by never running. It now accepts the classification fields the normalizer
computes.

**Scoping is a design decision, not a filter.** `AZ-DB-002` returns
NOT_APPLICABLE below HIGH sensitivity, and a shared-key-access rule was written
and then not shipped: shared key is on by default, so it would have fired on
essentially every storage account in existence. A rule that fires everywhere
teaches people to stop reading, and the cost lands on the finding next to it.

---

## 57. The scanner role reads a vault's configuration and none of its contents

Key vault was the largest gap in the catalogue and the first one closed by
adding collection rather than by writing rules against evidence that already
existed. It is worth recording as a shape, because every remaining gap —
database auditing, disk encryption, activity logs — is the same shape.

**One action, and precisely one.** `Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/read` is the
management plane: whether the vault can be purged, whether it answers the
public internet, which authorization model it uses. It grants nothing over the
keys, secrets and certificates inside, which live behind
`Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults/secrets/read` and a separate permission model that
CloudGuard does not request and should never request. A product that can tell a
customer their vault is destroyable *without being able to read a single secret
in it* is making a stronger claim than one that can do both, and a test asserts
the role holds no other `Microsoft.KeyVault/` action so that stays true.

**The role is versioned, so the cost lands as a prompt rather than a 403.**
`ROLE_HISTORY` gains a `v3` entry written out literally beside v1 and v2 — never
by reference, for the reason recorded in that file. A customer still on v2 keeps
every other category and loses only the vault checks, which then report UNKNOWN;
`categories_behind("v2")` is exactly `{SECRETS}`, and a test says so, because an
upgrade that quietly cost them an unrelated category would be worse than the gap
it closed.

**Absent and false are different answers, and Azure means different things by
them.** `enableSoftDelete` comes back as a value; `enablePurgeProtection` is
omitted when it has never been set. So AZ-KV-001 reads a missing purge
protection as off and a missing soft delete as missing — reversed, the rule
would either report nothing for the overwhelming majority of vaults that
genuinely lack purge protection, or report a gap CloudGuard invented.

**Sensitivity comes from the context engine, not from the normalizer.** A vault
holds the credentials to everything else, so an untagged one is not an
unclassified asset. That is expressed by adding `KEY_VAULT` to
`DATA_HOLDING_TYPES`, which carries the `TYPE_FLOOR` source with it — a first
attempt overrode criticality inside the normalizer instead, which would have
produced a HIGH nobody could trace to a reason.

**And check whether the gap costs a permission before assuming it does.** The
subscription activity log looked like the next role bump and was not. A
subscription is a scope diagnostic settings apply to like any other, so
`Microsoft.Insights/diagnosticSettings/read` — granted since v1 — already
reaches it, and the collector simply asks about one more id. AZ-LOG-002 is
therefore live for every existing customer with no redeploy, which is worth more
than the two vault rules that need one.

The two logging rules divide cleanly and must keep doing so. AZ-LOG-001 asks
whether a resource records what happens *to* it; AZ-LOG-002 asks whether the
subscription records *who did it*, across every resource including the ones that
no longer exist. A test asserts AZ-LOG-002 applies to subscriptions and nothing
else — if both claimed the same asset, one problem would be raised twice with
two different fixes.

---

## 58. v4 grants one action, because two of the three candidates were not worth one

The plan going into v4 was SQL auditing, transparent data encryption and
managed disk encryption, batched into a single redeploy prompt rather than
three. Two of the three did not survive being looked at.

**Transparent data encryption has been on by default since 2017**, and
**managed disks are always encrypted at rest and cannot be turned off**. Checks
for either would have cost a permission, a per-database fan-out, and a place in
the catalogue, to report PASS for very nearly every customer. That is how a rule
set grows in size and shrinks in signal — the failure mode ROADMAP.md warns
about, arrived at through diligence rather than laziness.

**SQL auditing is the opposite and is the whole of v4.** It is off by default on
every Azure SQL server, so it is a setting most customers have never turned on
rather than one they turned off. It costs one call per server, folded into the
task that already lists them, and it pairs with AZ-DB-001: a publicly reachable
database with no audit trail is the worst combination this catalogue can
describe, and the auditing finding carries `public_network_access` in its
evidence so the two read together.

**The rule declares no expected state, and that is the honest form.**
`Comparison` offers three checks and says in its own docstring that anything
they cannot express stays undeclared rather than half-declared. AZ-DB-003 checks
two things about one nested setting — auditing is on, and it writes somewhere —
which none of the three express. A declaration saying only "state is Enabled"
would have a customer satisfy exactly what they were shown, still be auditing to
nowhere, and watch the finding stay open. So the spec is the empty form, with
the reason in `notes` and the commands still handed over.

**Two failure modes, reported apart.** Off is a switch; on-with-no-destination
is the setting people believe they have. The fix differs, so the finding says
which it found.

**And the UNKNOWN names the role.** A customer still on v3 gets a 403 on this
one call while the server listing and firewall rules succeed, so every SQL
server they own reports UNKNOWN. The message says the deployed role may predate
the permission, because an unexplained UNKNOWN on every database is worse than
the gap it describes.

---

## 59. The access panel stopped calling a stale role verified

`role_upgrade_available` has been on the connection payload since role versions
existed, computed correctly, and read by nothing. So bumping the role to ship a
check — twice in a week, v3 for key vaults and v4 for SQL auditing — left every
existing customer collecting UNKNOWN across whole categories while the access
panel printed their role in the same green as a current one, next to the word
"verified".

That is the failure `role_upgrade_available`'s own docstring says the mechanism
exists to prevent, reached anyway because the last step was never taken. A
backend that knows and a screen that does not is indistinguishable from a
backend that does not know.

**Three states, not two.** The role is now green when current, red when never
granted, and amber when behind. Behind is not a failure — most checks are
running on it — and painting it red would send somebody to fix an outage they do
not have.

**Named, not counted.** "Two categories are degraded" is a notification;
"Databases, Key vaults" is a decision. The categories come from
`degraded_categories`, the same function the scanner uses to explain its own
gaps, so the screen and the scan cannot disagree about which checks are
affected. The customer-facing labels live in the frontend — `secrets` is what
the permission model calls a key vault, and "Key vault" is what the customer
went looking for.

**The panel states the invariant where it is felt.** The affected checks report
"not known" rather than passing, and the alert says so: a customer who assumed
silence meant a pass would draw exactly the wrong conclusion, and this is the
one screen where that assumption is most tempting.

**The redeploy link is the setup wizard's link.** Redeploying is deploying again
— the template carries the current role definition — so a second route would be
inventing one, and it is omitted entirely when there is no template URL to point
at, because a dead button is worse than none.

**And the seam test earned its keep.** The first attempt imported
`rbac.ROLE_VERSION` straight into the route to report which version to redeploy
toward. The route layer is provider-neutral and a role version is not, so it now
asks `required_role_version`, which returns `None` for a provider with no such
notion.

**The collection panel was not the liar; the SQL task was.** The panel reports
each reading's outcome, and the SQL reading came back COMPLETE while every
auditing verdict was UNKNOWN. That task makes three calls -- the servers, then
each server's firewall rules and auditing settings -- and a per-server failure
was recorded on the server for the rules to degrade on and nowhere else. So the
one screen whose job is saying what was and was not read said everything was.
A role predating v4 produces exactly this: a 403 on every auditing call while
the listing and firewall rules succeed. `_arm_task` now accepts a `TaskData`
from a call that knows something about its own completeness the wrapper cannot
see, and reports both reasons when a truncated listing and a half-read server
apply at once.

**And the invariant was stated for PARTIAL and nowhere else.** A scan where
storage failed outright showed a badge, a count, and no word about what it cost
-- leaving "could not read" free to be read as "nothing to report", which is the
one inference this product exists to prevent. Two sentences rather than one
covering both, because the reasons differ: an incomplete listing cannot support
a pass, and an absent one supports nothing at all.

`degraded_categories` on the collection payload is deliberately still not
rendered. It rolls up the same per-reading outcomes the list underneath already
shows one by one, and a summary that repeats the thing below it adds a place for
the two to disagree rather than a fact.

**And making that PARTIAL truthful exposed the next layer of the same
mistake.** A rule degrades on the evidence *keys* it declares, and the SQL
listing was one key covering three calls -- the servers, their firewall rules,
and their auditing settings. So the moment a refused auditing read correctly
made the reading PARTIAL, it also took AZ-DB-001's verdict, over a call that
rule never reads. That is the gap CloudGuard invents rather than finds, and it
is precisely what `requires_evidence` was introduced to stop when rules named
whole categories instead of keys. The same error, one layer down: a key naming
three calls is a category wearing a key's name.

Auditing is now its own key and its own dependent task, keyed per server the
way diagnostics is. AZ-DB-001 declares `SQL_SERVERS`; AZ-DB-003 declares both,
because without the listing there are no servers to judge and without the
auditing read there is no posture to judge them on. A role predating v4 now
costs exactly one rule its verdict, and the reading's detail names the role as
the likely cause rather than leaving a v3 customer with an unexplained partial
on every scan.

The general form, worth stating because there will be a next one: **an evidence
key is the unit a rule depends on, so two calls belong under one key only when
no rule could depend on one without the other.** Separately deniable means
separately keyed.

**`RESOURCES` was checked for the same defect and does not have it — it has a
different one.** No rule declares the inventory, so a failed Resource Graph
query costs no check its verdict; every rule reads its own service listing
instead. Two tests now hold that, and hold the pair to it: the key stays in
`baseline_evidence`, because a plan derived from the rule set would otherwise
stop collecting it silently.

What was wrong was the justification. `BASELINE_EVIDENCE` claimed the customer's
asset list was made of the inventory, and it is not — every asset CloudGuard
shows comes from the per-service listings, normalized into `cloud_resources`.
The Resource Graph payload is stored verbatim in every snapshot and read by
nothing, anywhere. Both docstrings also said "these three" for a set of five,
the two control readings having been added without updating the count.

So the honest statement got written down — and then built. The inventory is the
one reading that covers resource types no rule has been written for, and the
asset list now says so.

**Resources no service listing produced become assets carrying
`ResourceType.UNKNOWN`.** That type is the load-bearing part: no rule's
`applies_to` names it, so nothing judges them and none can become a PASS nobody
earned. They are counted, listed, and reported as unchecked — which is a fact
about CloudGuard's limits rather than about the customer's estate, and the one
thing a customer cannot work out for themselves.

**Nothing is counted twice.** The inventory covers the same storage accounts the
storage listing already produced, in far less detail, so it is filtered against
the assets already normalized — including against itself, since a repeated
Resource Graph row would otherwise be a repeated asset. Two rows for one asset
would be an inventory that miscounts and a graph holding the same thing twice.

**The real Azure type travels with them.** A list row reading "Unknown" would be
a worse answer than the omission it replaced: the point of showing these is that
the customer can see *what* is unchecked, not merely how many. `azure_type` is
null for a modelled asset, whose cloud-neutral label is the better one.

**Exposure stays UNKNOWN rather than LOW.** Resource Graph's projection excludes
`properties` deliberately, so there is no configuration here to establish
exposure from, and LOW would be reassurance CloudGuard did not earn.

**The count is phrased as a limit, not a percentage.** "35 with no checks yet"
rather than "74% coverage": a percentage invites the reader to feel good about a
high one, and the useful question is which resources are unexamined.

---

## 60. A control says why it is inconclusive, not only that it is

The compliance page already distinguished the five verdicts properly — labels,
dashed styling for INCONCLUSIVE so a control CloudGuard could not evaluate never
looks like one it cleared, and NOT_COVERED quieter still. That part was right and
stays.

What it could not answer was the question INCONCLUSIVE raises and the other four
do not. FAILING points at findings. PASSING needs nothing. NOT_COVERED is a fact
about CloudGuard with no action behind it. NOT_ASSESSED resolves itself on the
next scan. "Three rules could not be evaluated" points nowhere — and the
sentence that answers it has been sitting in `scan_evaluation_gaps` since
UNKNOWN became a recorded outcome, written by the rule that gave up, and never
read by this view.

It matters more than it did. Since the scanner role started gaining permissions,
the answer is frequently "your deployed role predates the permission this
needs", which is a thing a customer can act on this afternoon — and the access
panel now says the same thing one screen over, so the two agree.

**Distinct per rule, and capped at three.** The ledger holds one row per
resource, so forty storage accounts that failed for one reason are one sentence.
A tuple rather than a single string because one rule can fail differently on
different resources — a listing that timed out and a configuration that never
arrived are two causes, and collapsing them would name the wrong one for half
the assets. Past the cap it is a scan-level question, and the collection panel
answers it in full.

**The explanation never softens the verdict.** Knowing why CloudGuard could not
look is not the same as having looked, and a test says so explicitly: an
explained UNKNOWN is still INCONCLUSIVE, and a failing rule still outranks it.
This is the one screen somebody might put in front of an auditor.

The page had no test at all before this. It has five now, including the one that
matters most: a control nothing checks and a control that could not tell must
never render the same.

**And one flaky test found on the way, fixed rather than tolerated.** The
finding detail page draws on three independent queries — the finding, its attack
paths, its provenance — which settle in whatever order they settle in. A test
awaited the first sentence and then read two more synchronously, which proves
nothing about the second and third, and lost the race whenever the machine was
busy. Every assertion awaits now.

Worth recording how it was nearly missed: the suite had been run as
`npx vitest run … | tail`, and a pipeline reports the exit code of its *last*
stage, so vitest's failure read as a pass. A verification command that cannot
fail is not a verification command.

**And a React key warning that had been scrolling past in green runs.** The
assets table renders each group as a heading row plus its assets, wrapped in a
`<>` fragment returned from a `.map()`. The rows inside were keyed all along,
which is what made it look fine — but the *wrapper* is what sits in the list,
and the shorthand fragment cannot take a key. React answers a list child it
cannot identify by reusing the wrong DOM under a changed key: rows appearing
under the wrong heading after a regrouping, invisible to any test asserting on
first paint.

The instance is a one-line fix, `<Fragment key={groupName}>`. The interesting
part is that a test asserting on the console does **not** hold it: React
de-duplicates these per call site, so such a test catches the warning only if it
happens to run before every other test that renders the same component. Written
that way it passed with the fix reverted — which is worse than no test, because
it reports a guarantee it does not provide.

So the guard is in the shared test setup instead, and fails any test that
produces one. Narrow on purpose: failing every `console.error` would fail tests
deliberately exercising error paths, and the class worth catching here is
specific. Verified the honest way — with the fix reverted, the suite fails; with
it in place, it passes.

## 61. Three more frameworks, and no new scanning

NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5, the SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria and PCI DSS v4.0.1 are
now catalogued. None of them cost a rule. That is the whole point of the mapping layer: a rule is the
reusable unit, a framework is a set of references to it, and a seventh catalogue
is a data change rather than a scanning engine. A test asserts every rule maps
to all three, and that no rule was written *for* any of them — a rule named after a
standard would be the same technical check duplicated per standard, which is the
failure the compliance layer exists to prevent.

**800-53 is a US Government work and could be quoted; SOC 2's criteria are
AICPA's and cannot.** Both are described in CloudGuard's own words anyway, so
the two pages read alike and the rule at the top of the catalogue holds without
exception. The identifiers are the durable part; `url` points at the
authoritative text.

**SOC 2 is the easiest page in this product to overreach on**, and the catalogue
is shaped to make that hard. Its criteria are mostly about whether an
organization *has* a control and operates it — CC1 through CC5 are control
environment, communication, risk assessment, monitoring and control activities,
and a scanner reads none of them. Nine of twenty-seven criteria are technically
assessable and the rest are listed unassessable rather than omitted, so the page
reports honest partial coverage instead of implying a SOC 2 report is a
configuration problem. The scope note says in as many words that only a licensed
firm can issue the opinion.

A test asserts fewer than half of SOC 2's criteria are assessable, and the first
version of the catalogue failed it at exactly half — because the catalogue was
understating how organizational the standard is, not because the assertion was
wrong. Seven more of the organizational criteria were named. That is the right
direction to resolve that failure in: the honest ratio is a fact about SOC 2,
and a catalogue that flattered CloudGuard's reach would be the thing at fault.

**Both list controls no rule covers**, as every framework here does — 800-53
covers 16 of 24, SOC 2 8 of 27. The uncovered ones are the backlog and the
never: `RA-5` and `SI-2` want vulnerability data CloudGuard does not collect,
`CC6.8` wants anti-malware status, and `PE-3` wants somebody to walk into a
building.

**PCI DSS v4.0.1 followed, and it carries the caveat that matters most.** The
standard applies to the cardholder data environment, and CloudGuard does not
know which resources are in it — scope is a decision a QSA makes with the
merchant about segmentation and data flows, and every figure on that page is
computed over the whole subscription instead. A resource group holding no card
data is counted exactly like the one that does.

That caveat is more consequential than SOC 2's, because PCI is contractual
rather than advisory: a merchant assessed against it can lose the ability to
take payments, so a page implying it had assessed them would be doing harm
rather than merely overreaching. The scope note says so first, before anything
else, and a test asserts it.

PCI's uncovered controls also divide cleanly in a way worth keeping visible.
`9.1.1`, `11.4.1`, `12.1.1` and `12.10.1` — physical access, penetration
testing, policy, incident response — are marked unassessable because no scanner
reaches them. `5.2.1`, `6.3.3` and `11.3.1` — anti-malware, patching,
vulnerability scanning — stay *assessable* and uncovered, because a scanner
could report them and this one does not collect the evidence. Backlog and never
are different answers and the catalogue distinguishes them.

**One bug I introduced and caught before it shipped.** The PCI scope note was
written with markdown emphasis around the scope caveat.
`ComplianceFramework.tsx` renders `{data.scope_note}` straight into JSX, so it
would have reached the customer as two literal asterisks — on the page that
most needs to be believed. A test now rejects markup in any framework's
customer-facing text, because the place a caveat most wants emphasis is exactly
where the next person will reach for it.

The frontend needed no change at all, which is the property worth noting: no
page branches on a framework id, so the compliance views rendered three new
catalogues the moment the API listed them.

## 62. Defender's findings are evidence, not verdicts to repeat

Six controls across four frameworks wanted the same thing — NIST `RA-5` and
`SI-2`, SOC 2 `CC6.8`, PCI `5.2.1`, `6.3.3` and `11.3.1` — and no ARM
configuration answers any of them. Whether a machine is patched, and whether an
agent is installed and healthy, are facts only the machine knows. Microsoft
Defender for Cloud is what knows the machine, so v5 of the scanner role reads
its assessments.

**The line worth holding is what a rule does with them.** Defender has already
reached a verdict on every asset it assesses. Mirroring those as CloudGuard
rules would turn two hundred assessments into two hundred findings, none of
which a customer could not already see in the Azure portal — a product that adds
a second inbox rather than a decision.

What CloudGuard has and Defender does not is the graph. So an assessment is read
as evidence: `AZ-VULN-001` fires only where Defender's vulnerability finding
meets CloudGuard's own knowledge that the machine answers the internet, and
returns NOT_APPLICABLE otherwise — explicitly, because Defender raises the
vulnerability on its own terms and there is nothing there CloudGuard knows that
Defender did not say better. The finding is the pairing, which neither says
alone.

**Severity stays Microsoft's, under Microsoft's name.** `provider_severity`
rather than mapped onto CloudGuard's scale: the two were tuned by different
people for different purposes, and quietly equating them would put somebody
else's judgement inside this product's risk formula.

**Only unhealthy assessments are kept.** A healthy one is Defender's verdict
rather than CloudGuard's evidence, and several hundred per subscription in every
snapshot would store a great deal to say nothing. `NotApplicable` is dropped for
a stronger reason: it frequently means the assessment could not run, and reading
it as a pass is the overclaim this engine refuses everywhere.

**And the absence is the case to get right.** A subscription with no Defender
plan returns no assessments. `security_assessments` is therefore absent on an
asset nothing assessed and an empty list on one Defender looked at and cleared —
None is UNKNOWN, `[]` is a PASS somebody earned. Reading the first as clean
would be an absence of evidence reported as evidence of absence, on the class of
finding a customer is most likely to believe.

**One catalogue correction fell out of it.** Mapping these rules gave NIST CSF
100% coverage, which `test_catalogue_lists_controls_no_rule_covers` refused —
correctly, and the fault was the catalogue rather than a mapping. CSF holds over
a hundred subcategories and this catalogue listed thirteen, all from Protect and
Detect, while its own scope note said Identify, Respond and Recover were out of
reach without naming any of them. Five are named now. The same correction as SOC
2's: a framework that reports full coverage is a catalogue understating the
framework.

## 63. The last two identity gaps cost a collector, not a consent

Application credential expiry and dormant privileged accounts are the two
categories `RULE_ENGINE.md` names as absent because the evidence is. Both were
assumed to be blocked behind a second Global Administrator consent — a per-tenant
ask heavier than anything CloudGuard has needed since onboarding, and worth
deciding deliberately. Checked rather than assumed, the ask is not there.

**The consent screen is already wider than the collector.**
`REQUIRED_GRAPH_PERMISSIONS` has carried `Application.Read.All` and
`AuditLog.Read.All` since the two-click redesign, alongside
`IdentityRiskyUser.Read.All`. No collector calls anything that needs any of the
three. So every tenant that has ever consented to this application granted them
at the moment they clicked, and the two gaps are collector work under permissions
already in hand — no redeploy, no re-consent, nothing to ask a customer for.

* Credential expiry reads `/applications` and `/servicePrincipals` for
  `passwordCredentials` and `keyCredentials`, which `Application.Read.All`
  covers.
* Dormancy needs no new object at all: role members are already collected. The
  missing field is `signInActivity` on `/users`, which Graph gates on
  `AuditLog.Read.All` *and* `User.Read.All` — both granted.

A tenant that consented against an older registration would be the exception,
and needs no campaign to find: `missing_permissions` reads the granted
permissions out of the token's `roles` claim and names exactly what is absent,
per tenant, on every scan.

**The real gate on dormancy is a licence, and it is not consent's problem.**
`signInActivity` requires Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2. A Free tenant with
complete consent still gets a 403, and the fix is a licence its administrator may
have decided against on purpose. That has to degrade as its own reason: this
scan could not read sign-in activity because the tenant is not licensed for it —
UNKNOWN with a sentence, like every other gap here. Reporting it as a permission
problem would send a Global Administrator to a consent screen that cannot fix it,
which is the failure `client.py`'s access-denied hints exist to prevent.

**Why the mistake was available to make is worth fixing too.** The ARM half of
the grant asserts this exact thing: `ROLE_ONLY_ACTIONS` derives every action the
role requests that no client call reaches, and a test asserts it empty, so a
permission on a customer's consent screen that nothing uses cannot survive a
build. The Graph half has no equivalent — which is how three unused permissions
sat there long enough for the collector's reach to be read off the code rather
than off the consent screen. The same derivation belongs on the Graph side, and
it turns green as these two collectors land rather than before.

---

## 64. Both collectors landed, and an expiry date is not a finding

§63 established that application credentials and dormant accounts were a
collector rather than a consent. Building them settled four things that were
not obvious from the outside.

**An expired credential is an outage, not an exposure.** The gap was named
"application credential expiry", and the obvious rule — this secret has expired,
or expires next week — is one CloudGuard should not ship. An expired secret
grants nobody anything; an application has stopped working, which the customer's
own alerting is better placed to notice than a security tool is. What an
attacker actually gets from an expiry date is its *remaining* life: a secret
copied out of a pipeline log today keeps working until the day it was issued
for. So AZ-APP-001 asks how long a stolen credential would keep working, fails
above a year, and passes an expired one explicitly.

The registration is the asset rather than each credential. One application with
four long-lived secrets is one thing to fix, and four findings for it would be
the score charged four times for a single rotation.

Service principal credentials are deliberately not read. They exist, and reading
them means listing every service principal in the tenant — several hundred of
them Microsoft's — for the handful a customer created. That is the trade the
Conditional Access collector already made when it read back only the groups a
policy names: a directory dump for a few ids is worse than the narrower answer,
and what a customer rotates is the registration. AZ-APP-001's finding says so rather than claiming to cover
every credential in the tenant.

**A licence is not a consent, and must not be reported as one.**
`signInActivity` needs Entra ID P1 or P2 on top of the grant every tenant
already has. A free-tier tenant with complete consent is refused it with a 403 —
the same status code a missing permission produces, from the same endpoint. The
collector reads Graph's own explanation and rewrites only that case, so the
tenant is told about a licence its administrator may have declined on purpose,
rather than being sent to a consent screen that cannot fix it. Everything else
keeps the existing behaviour of naming the permissions consent did not grant.

**An age has to be measured from the capture.** Days remaining on a credential
and days since a sign-in are the first evidence in this product that is a
duration rather than a value, and a duration computed against `now()` would make
a rule a function of when it was asked instead of what it read — so a replayed
snapshot would reach a different verdict from the same JSON, and "CloudGuard
verified the fix" would mean nothing. `RawSnapshot` carries `collected_at`, it
round-trips through `to_json`, and the normalizer measures every age from it.
The rules see plain numbers and stay pure.

**And the Graph side now asserts what ARM already did.** `ROLE_ONLY_ACTIONS`
has long derived every ARM action the scanner role requests that no collector
reaches, and a test keeps it empty. Graph had no equivalent, which is exactly
how three requested-and-unused permissions went unnoticed long enough for §63's
mistake to be available. `GRAPH_PERMISSION_USE` names the call behind each
permission and a test refuses any that is neither used nor reserved.

`IdentityRiskyUser.Read.All` is the one reserved entry. Trimming it would be the
tidier-looking move and the wrong one: §63's whole point is that a permission
already on the consent screen is one a future collector spends nothing to use,
and dropping it would sell that for a shorter list. Reserved with a reason keeps
it a decision rather than an oversight.

## 55. A payload is stored as compressed bytes, not as JSONB

§54 removed the copies. This removes the size of what is left.

`evidence_blobs.payload` was JSONB, which is the wrong representation for what
these rows hold. A payload is a provider listing — five hundred near-identical
objects repeating the same twenty key names, the same resource-group prefix on
every id, the same `"provisioningState": "Succeeded"` on every row — and JSONB
stores that as a parsed tree with the key names held per value. PostgreSQL's
TOAST compression only engages above a couple of kilobytes, and by then the
expensive representation has already been chosen. The column is now `bytea`
holding zlib-compressed bytes: roughly a tenth of the size on this input.

**Nothing was given up, because nothing used it.** A payload is read whole, by
hash, in `_rebuild_capture` and in the evidence planner, or not at all. There is
no query anywhere that reaches into one with a JSONB operator, and the rules
read the *normalized* `CloudResource`, never the stored blob. So the JSONB
operators being lost were never load-bearing — which is the only thing that
makes this a size change rather than a capability change.

**The stored bytes are the hashed bytes.** `canonical()` is the one
serialization the content hash is ever taken over, and it is that exact byte
string that gets compressed and written. So a stored payload is checkable
against the hash it is filed under: inflate, hash, compare, which is what
`test_a_stored_payload_still_hashes_to_the_hash_it_is_filed_under` does against
real scans. A version that compressed a fresh `json.dumps` would round-trip to
an equal dict through a different byte string, and that check would become a
coin toss between a real corruption and a whitespace difference.

**zlib rather than zstd.** zstd would get perhaps a fifth off zlib's result on
this input, at the price of a native wheel in the API image, the worker image
and CI, for bytes already an order of magnitude down. The compression also runs
on the scan's hot path, so the level is 6 rather than 9: level 9 spends
noticeably longer for low single digits on JSON this repetitive.

**No backfill, and a CHECK instead.** Rewriting every historical payload is a
long write on the largest table in the schema, and retention retires those rows
on its own schedule anyway — so `payload` is kept, made nullable, and read as a
fallback, exactly as §54 kept `cloud_snapshots.data`. What 0028 does add is a
CHECK that a row holds one form or the other. Without it, a row that had lost
its bytes would read back as `{}`, and an empty payload is a real thing a
subscription with no storage accounts produces: "the bytes are gone" would be
indistinguishable from "there was nothing there", which is the same class of
error as UNKNOWN being read as PASS.

The downgrade inflates the compressed rows back into `payload` before dropping
the column, in Python and a page at a time. PostgreSQL ships no zlib inflate —
`pg_column_compression` reports how a value is TOASTed and nothing undoes an
application-level `zlib.compress` — so a SQL-only downgrade would have had to
discard every reading taken while compression was in use.

**And the write path stopped reading what it was about to skip.** `_store_blobs`
loaded whole `EvidenceBlob` rows to decide which payloads were already stored,
then set `last_seen_at` on them. On an unchanged estate — the case content
addressing exists for, and the common one — that read every payload it already
held back out of PostgreSQL, decompressed nothing, used none of it, and wrote a
timestamp. It now selects the hashes alone and touches them with one `UPDATE`,
guarded by `last_seen_at < observed_at` so a replay of a capture collected in
March cannot make its payloads look freshly read.

---

## 65. What holds a step, what stops two scans, and what a tenant may keep

Five production problems in the scanning path, all of them invisible in a
demo tenant and all of them certain in a large one. They are recorded together
because four of the five are the same mistake in different places: a mechanism
that was correct about the state it wrote and silent about who was entitled to
write it.

**A step is fenced by the attempt it was claimed under.** The lease made a
redeploy survivable: a step that stops renewing is returned to PENDING and run
again elsewhere. What it did not handle is the worker coming back. A process
paused past its lease -- a throttled container, a database stall, a long
garbage collection -- has not died, and it finished its collection minutes
later and marked the step SUCCEEDED while another worker was in the middle of
the same step. ANALYZE waits on collection *settling*, so the scan then
interpreted a subscription still being written and reported it as a complete
reading: the same overclaim as a PASS nobody earned, arriving through the
orchestrator instead of through a rule. Renewals and settles are now
conditional on the row still carrying the attempt the worker claimed, and a
worker that lost its step writes nothing. The renewal fence matters as much as
the settle: unfenced, the returning worker kept alive the lease of a step
somebody else was running, so the mechanism that reports a lost step was the
thing concealing that two workers held it.

**The lease is held by a clock, not by whatever the phase reports.** Renewal
used to happen inside collection's progress callback, which covered one of the
three step kinds. ANALYZE -- reconstructing every capture, evaluating every
rule, scoring every finding, the longest thing a scan does -- renewed nothing.
A tenant whose analysis ran past `ScanStep.LEASE_SECONDS` had its step reaped
mid-evaluation and restarted while the first was still writing, so the one case
where the reaper reliably fired was the case where nothing had gone wrong, and
it fired more reliably the larger the tenant. A background keeper now renews on
a fraction of the window for every kind of step, and a refused renewal stops the
work at the next opportunity rather than spending the customer's Azure quota on
a capture that will be discarded.

**One target, one lock.** Starting a scan takes a transaction-scoped advisory
lock and then checks whether one is already in flight. The lock was keyed on
whichever ids the caller happened to hold, and the callers do not agree: the API
and the rescan button pass a connection *and* the subscription they resolved it
from, while the scheduler, the change trigger and the verification sweep pass
the connection alone. Those are two different locks over one connection, so a
customer pressing "Scan now" at the moment the scheduler started the same
connection got two scans writing findings for the same resources -- and the
unique index on (organization, rule, resource) turned the overlap into a scan
that failed with nothing a customer could read. The key is now the connection
wherever there is one, which is exactly the set the in-flight check treats as
overlapping.

**A lost message no longer strands a scan.** `unfinished_scan_ids` was written
as the safety net for an advance message the broker never delivered, and nothing
called it. A PENDING step holds no lease to expire, and the scan reaper
deliberately skips a scan with a live step -- so such a scan sat at whatever
percentage it had reached, permanently, with its connection answering "a scan is
already running". The reaper now nudges every scan with work outstanding, which
is a no-op on the normal path where a step enqueues its own successor.

**A step carries its own time limits, and a worker reserves one at a time.**
The general Celery ceiling bounds the short tasks, where anything past a minute
is a fault. A step is not that: one evaluation of an entire tenant legitimately
runs for half an hour, and cutting it at the general limit turned a large tenant
into a killed worker that the reaper retried at the same size -- three attempts,
three kills, and a failure whose only cause was the number of subscriptions the
customer owned. Prefetch drops to one for the same reason: a reserved message is
invisible to every other worker, so the default of four left three tenant-sized
steps idle inside one process while the queue looked empty to the rest of the
pool.

**Retention is a count as well as a window.** Days alone is a policy about time,
and storage is not spent in time. A customer scanning every half hour writes 48
captures a day per subscription and 1,440 inside a 30-day window; a customer
scanning weekly writes 4. Both are inside the same stated retention and their
tables are two orders of magnitude apart, which is how one tenant enabling
change-triggered scanning becomes the reason a shared database fills up. A
per-scope ceiling caps the series, ranked in PostgreSQL by the same
(created_at, id) order the replay path uses -- and the newest capture of a scope
is exempt from the ceiling exactly as it is from the window, because it is what
an applied replay reads.

**Evidence records which scan read the provider.** A reading inside its reuse
window is carried into the next scan, which writes a row of its own under its
own id holding the original's `collected_at`. The age survived; the authorship
did not. `finding_evidence.source_scan_id` exists precisely to say that the
collecting scan is not necessarily the scan that raised the finding, and it was
copied from `evidence.scan_id`, which could only ever name the latter -- so a
customer following a citation back to the reading it rests on was handed a scan
that made no such call. `evidence.source_scan_id` (migration 0031) carries the
collecting scan, NULL meaning this row is the reading, and a carried row's
source is followed rather than restarted so the trail stays one hop long however
many scans have reused it.

**And one performance change with no correctness argument behind it.**
Rebuilding a capture fetched its own stored readings, so an analysis of a
fifty-subscription tenant opened with fifty queries against the largest table in
the schema before a single rule ran. The readings are content-addressed and the
captures share them; they are now fetched once and handed down.

## 66. The frontend's own production failures

Four of them, all invisible in development and none of them a bug in any
feature. Development serves every module from a running dev server, never
redeploys under an open tab, and talks to an API on localhost that either
answers or refuses immediately -- so the conditions below only exist once the
thing is deployed.

**Nothing caught a thrown error, so the page went white.** React unmounts the
whole tree when a render throws and nothing catches it: no message, no way back,
and nothing on screen for a customer to describe to support. For a product whose
job is telling somebody whether their cloud is secure, a blank page is the worst
available answer. There is now a boundary at the root and a second one around
the router's outlet, so a page that throws leaves the reader with the navigation
they arrived by rather than an empty document.

**The most common cause of that blank page was not a bug at all.** Every page is
a dynamic import, and a deploy replaces the hashed files a tab already open was
going to fetch. Somebody who leaves CloudGuard open, gets a release, then clicks
Findings asks for a chunk that no longer exists; the import rejects, and the
`Suspense` boundary above it has nothing to catch it. That is not an error to
report -- it is a page that needs the new build -- so the boundary recognises
the shape of it and reloads once, guarded in session storage. Once, because a
reload that hits the same error again loops for ever, which is a worse blank
page than the one it replaced.

**A hanging request never resolved.** `fetch` has no timeout and neither does
TanStack Query, so a host that accepts the connection and then says nothing --
a container mid-redeploy, a captive portal, a mobile connection that dropped --
left the query in `isLoading` for as long as the tab stayed open. Requests are
now bounded (30s, and 120s for a report, which is rendered on demand and
legitimately slow), and a rejected fetch is reported as an unreachable API
rather than as the browser's own "Failed to fetch", which reads to a customer as
a bug in CloudGuard.

**An expired session read as a broken product.** Only the dashboard noticed a
401, and it noticed by rendering an error where its charts go. Everywhere else
every panel on the page failed with its own message, none of them said "signed
out", and nothing offered the action that fixes it. A 401 now clears the token,
which puts the router back in charge and sends the reader to sign in. A 403 is
deliberately not this: a viewer refused a write is signed in and should stay
signed in, and answering "you may not do that" with "prove who you are" would
land them back at the same refusal.

And one smaller thing found on the way: the query client retried every failure
once, including the ones the server has already answered definitively. Retrying
is now limited to the failures where nobody actually answered -- a 5xx, a
timeout, a dropped connection.

## 67. A control cites its readings, and the whole assessment leaves as a file

The compliance view walked the chain the product claims -- reading, rule,
control, framework -- in one direction only, and stopped one link short at each
end.

**At the evidence end it could only explain failure.** A finding cites the
readings behind it (`finding_evidence`), so "how do you know this is wrong" had
an answer. A *passing* control has no findings, so it had no citations at all:
CloudGuard painted a green row and offered nothing to check it against, on the
one screen somebody might put in front of an auditor. The question an auditor
actually asks first is the other one -- how do you know this control is met --
and the answer was "because no rule complained", which is an assertion, not
evidence.

So a control now carries the provider readings its verdict rests on, taken from
the rules' own declared evidence keys and the latest scan's `evidence` rows:
which listing, when the provider was read, across how many scopes, under which
permission, and whether the payload is still stored. Three choices inside that
are load-bearing:

* **The oldest read and the worst outcome, never an average.** A control is
  only as current and as complete as the least of the things it rests on.
  Averaging would let forty-nine freshly read subscriptions hide the one nobody
  could read, which is the same overclaim as a PASS nobody earned, arriving
  through arithmetic.
* **A key nothing read is listed, not omitted.** It reports no outcome rather
  than a failure -- the provider did not refuse, nothing asked -- and it is the
  case that matters most, because it is precisely how a control ends up green
  on nothing.
* **Retention is reported, not assumed.** The blob store is asked which hashes
  still exist rather than inferring it from the hash being present. A citation
  whose bytes have aged out is still a true statement about what was read, and
  saying so beats offering a link that fails.

The evidence keys come from the `rules` read-mirror rather than the Python
registry (migration 0032 adds `requires_evidence` beside `compliance_mappings`),
for the reason that table exists at all: a rule deleted from the registry keeps
its row, disabled, so the controls it used to answer for do not silently become
uncovered.

**At the other end it could not leave the browser.** An audit is run from a
spreadsheet, and a GRC platform ingests JSON; a screen is neither.
`GET /compliance/{id}/export?format=csv|json` is the assessment as a document --
every control, its verdict, the rules behind it and the readings behind those,
including the controls that passed. It answers with a file rather than the
`{data, error, meta}` envelope, as reports do, because the caller is saving
bytes to disk and an envelope would make every consumer unwrap a shape that
means nothing there.

Two details of the CSV are decisions rather than formatting. **Every row repeats
the framework, its version and when the assessment was read**, which is
redundant on screen and is the only thing that survives what actually happens to
an export: fifteen rows copied into a larger sheet, where a row that no longer
says which reading it came from is a compliance claim with no date on it. And
**booleans are written as yes/no**: a spreadsheet coerces TRUE/FALSE into its
own boolean type and then formats it in the reader's locale, so a German auditor
opens the file and finds WAHR.

Nothing here issues a score. The export says what was checked, what was found,
and what it was found from -- the same position `coverage_ratio` takes on the
screen, carried into the one artefact that outlives it.

## 68. Thirteen more rules, and the ten that were already the same finding

A catalogue of 25 checks grew to 38. The interesting part is not the thirteen
that were written; it is the twelve that were asked for and are not here, and
why each is missing.

**Ten of them already ship under a different id.** A public storage account is
AZ-STO-001, which covers anonymous blob access *and* an unrestricted network
default; a vault that can be purged is AZ-KV-001; an Any/Any inbound rule is
AZ-NET-003; a person or workload with subscription-wide control is AZ-IAM-001
and AZ-IAM-002; an identity that can hand out roles is AZ-IAM-003; a database
firewall admitting the whole internet is AZ-DB-001. Adding the requested ids
beside them would raise two findings for one misconfiguration, ask a customer
to close the same door twice, and deduct from the security score twice for
closing it once. The split was offered and declined deliberately: renaming
those rules into finer ids would orphan every finding raised under the old ones,
and the history is worth more than the taxonomy.

**Two more were near-duplicates found while building.** A subscription-level
Contributor is what AZ-IAM-001 already reports -- its ``FULL_CONTROL_ROLES`` is
Owner, Contributor and User Access Administrator, not Owner alone -- and a
managed identity with excessive privilege is AZ-IAM-002, which covers every
workload identity rather than only service principals.

**What is genuinely new falls into four groups.**

*The tenant, rather than anything in it.* AZ-ID-005 asks whether anything
enforces multi-factor authentication at all, and AZ-ID-006 whether legacy
authentication is blocked. Both are aggregate rules reading Conditional Access
and security defaults -- data CloudGuard already collected to *lower* findings'
scores as compensating controls, and had never read in the other direction. The
second is the one that matters most in practice: IMAP, POP, SMTP AUTH and
Exchange ActiveSync cannot present a second factor, so they bypass every policy
demanding one, and a tenant can enforce MFA everywhere and still accept a
password on those endpoints.

*The accounts nobody calls an administrator.* AZ-ID-004 asks for a second
factor on ordinary accounts, and is careful to decline the privileged ones,
which AZ-ID-001 already reports at Critical. AZ-ID-011 and AZ-ID-012 are the two
states a privileged account can be in that a role review does not show: a guest
whose password and second factor belong to another tenant's administrator, and a
disabled account whose privilege survived being disabled -- offboarding that
stopped halfway, one checkbox from being an administrator again.

*Privilege the subscription cannot see.* AZ-IAM-008 reports full control granted
at a management group or the tenant root, which every subscription beneath it
inherits, including the ones created next year. AZ-IAM-010 reads the tenant's
own role definitions: a custom role granting ``*``, or the right to write role
assignments, is Owner under a name a privilege review does not recognise -- and
``notActions`` is read the way ARM reads it, so a Contributor-shaped custom role
is not reported as dangerous. AZ-IAM-005 is the count rather than the holders:
no single Owner is the one too many, so it cannot be asked per identity.

*Exposure and evidence.* AZ-NET-005 and AZ-NET-008 give SQL and SMB rules of
their own, and both ports leave AZ-NET-003's catch-all list in the same change,
following the convention RDP, SSH and WinRM already set -- a port in both places
would be that double-reporting again. AZ-NET-015 reports a public address on a
machine the estate says is sensitive or business-critical, and declines to judge
one nothing has classified: AZ-CMP-001 already reports what the internet can
reach, and this is a statement about the data behind it. AZ-LOG-004 asks
AZ-LOG-001's question of the two security-relevant types it does not cover --
key vaults and machines -- with the applies-to sets deliberately disjoint and a
test holding them that way.

**AZ-DB-006 is a reversal, and is marked as one.** `RULE_ENGINE.md` recorded a
decision against a transparent-data-encryption check: it costs an ARM
permission and a per-database fan-out to report PASS for very nearly everyone,
since TDE has defaulted to on since 2017. That reasoning still holds on its own
terms. What changed is §67: a control's passes now carry the readings behind
them, so a pass on an encryption control is the evidence an auditor asks for by
name rather than a row nobody reads. The role goes to `v6` for it, which means
every existing connection reports "redeploy the role" until they do -- the
prompt is honest, the checks that need the new actions report UNKNOWN in the
meantime, and no other category is affected.

Two smaller things fell out of the work. `Microsoft.Sql/servers/databases/read`
and its transparent-data-encryption sibling are the first actions whose task
fans out two levels deep -- servers, then databases -- which is why the reading
is keyed separately: a role that cannot make those calls loses exactly that
check rather than the reachability rule beside it. And the ARM action matcher
moved from the normalizer into `rbac.py`, where the vocabulary it interprets
already lives, because three callers now need the same reading of a wildcard.

## 69. A reading is scoped by region; a verdict is not

The first thing AWS breaks is not a name. Azure's ARM lists a subscription's
resources globally, so one evidence key meant one reading, and every layer of
the collector took that for granted: the executor indexed tasks by key, the
coverage report indexed results by key, and `evidence` was unique on
`(scan_id, cloud_account_id, evidence_key)`. AWS reads almost everything per
region. An account with seventeen enabled regions produces seventeen readings
of `security_groups`, which the executor would have called a duplicate task and
the database would have refused.

The temptation is to put the region into the key — `security_groups_eu_west_1`
— and it is wrong for a reason that is not aesthetic. `EvidenceKey` is what a
rule declares in `requires_evidence`, and a rule has no business knowing which
regions a customer has enabled. A rule asking for the security groups is asking
about the estate.

So the two are separated. A **reading** is identified by key and region; a
**verdict** is reached per key.

* `CollectionTask` and `TaskResult` carry an optional `region`, and a
  `scoped_key` of `security_groups@eu-west-1`. `None` — every Azure task —
  leaves the scoped key equal to the bare one, so nothing about a
  single-region-free provider changed.
* `CoverageReport` files results and payloads under the scoped key, so
  seventeen readings are seventeen rows rather than one overwritten sixteen
  times.
* `key_is_trustworthy` aggregates back: a key is trustworthy only if **every**
  region's reading of it was. Not any. Sixteen good regions and one denied is a
  partial view of the estate, and "nothing is open" is not a conclusion a
  partial view supports — the same position `PARTIAL` already takes on a
  listing truncated at the page cap.
* `key_problems()` therefore reports one gap per key and names the regions
  inside the reason. Per region would hand the rule engine a key it has never
  heard of; without the region a customer would be told their security groups
  failed and left to check seventeen of them.

Dependencies follow the same split. `depends_on` names bare keys, and a key
becomes available only once every one of its regional tasks has been scheduled
— counted down rather than marked on the first, or a dependent task would fan
out from one region's results and report the rest as absent.

### What the capture holds

A regional key's payload is a list of blocks:

```json
{"security_groups": [{"region": "eu-west-1", "items": [ ... ]}, ...]}
```

The provider's own JSON is untouched inside `items`, which is what keeps the
capture verbatim and replayable. The region sits beside it rather than being
recovered later from an identifier, because several AWS services return ARNs
with an empty region field and a normalizer would have to guess.

`coverage` entries now state `key` and `region` explicitly instead of leaving
them to be parsed back out of the entry name. A record that has to be recovered
by splitting a string is a record that is a function of how the string happens
to be spelled.

### Two smaller things this forced

**A wave is now bounded.** Concurrency was unlimited because a wave was eleven
ARM listings. A regional fan-out puts one listing per region in a wave, and a
customer with seventeen regions would open a hundred and fifty concurrent calls
— a shape designed to be throttled, since AWS throttles per region per service.
`CollectionRun` takes `max_concurrency`; a provider that asks for nothing keeps
exactly the behaviour it had.

**A regional key cannot be carried forward.** `CollectionPlan.carried` is keyed
by evidence, and one entry cannot hold seventeen readings without silently
keeping whichever was written last. Reuse is opt-in per key through
`reuse_window`, which defaults to never, so a provider gets this right by
leaving it alone.

### The migration

`evidence` gains `region`, and the unique constraint is rebuilt over
`(scan_id, cloud_account_id, evidence_key, region)` with `NULLS NOT DISTINCT`.
Both nullable columns there mean "this reading is not scoped that way" — a
directory reading belongs to no subscription, a global listing to no region —
and two readings that are both unscoped are the same reading. Under Postgres's
default the NULLs would be distinct from each other and the constraint would
stop protecting the rows it exists for. Migration 0033 removes any duplicate
first rather than failing on a customer's database; it is expected to match
nothing, because the only rows the old constraint could not separate are
directory readings and a scan takes one directory capture.

Nothing above the connector changed. The rule engine, `RuleContext`, the risk
scorer and every rule still degrade one `EvidenceKey` at a time and have not
learned that regions exist.

## 70. Two neutral columns, one provider blob, and a rename not done

`MULTI_CLOUD.md` §3 proposed renaming `tenant_id` and `subscription_id` to
`provider_directory_id` and `provider_account_id`, plus a `provider_ref JSONB`
for what is genuinely provider-shaped. Half of that is now built and half of it
is deliberately not.

**The blob is built.** `cloud_connections` and `cloud_accounts` each gain
`provider_ref`. AWS needs two things Azure has no equivalent of — the scanner
role's ARN, and the external id its trust policy must require — and neither is
read by anything neutral. That is the line: `tenant_id` and `scope_id` are
columns because the scanner, the scheduler and the UI read them; nothing outside
one provider's own onboarding module ever looks inside `provider_ref`.

It holds no customer secret and must not start to. The external id is a name the
customer's trust policy pins against, not a credential to their cloud.
`cloud_account.py` has claimed since v0.1 that CloudGuard stores nothing that
could leak access to a customer's environment, and a JSONB column labelled
"provider-shaped" is the obvious place for that to quietly stop being true.

**The rename is not.** `RawSnapshot.to_json` writes `tenant_id` and
`subscription_id` into every stored capture. Renaming the columns without the
payload keys would leave two vocabularies for one pair of facts; renaming both
would make every capture already taken unreplayable, which is the one thing the
raw snapshot exists to prevent. The rename is worth doing against a migration
of the stored snapshots, and it is not worth doing inside the change that adds
the second provider — the same ordering `MULTI_CLOUD.md` §8 already argues for,
now with a specific reason rather than a general one.

The columns are neutral enough to carry AWS meanwhile: an organization id and an
account id, in the two columns whose names happen to be Azure's.

**`ConnectionScope` gained AWS's three levels** rather than growing a second
enum. Every cloud has the same shape — a trust boundary, a grouping inside it,
and the unit a scan reads — so it is one question with three answers per
provider:

```
Azure   TENANT_ROOT     MANAGEMENT_GROUP      SUBSCRIPTION
AWS     ORGANIZATION    ORGANIZATIONAL_UNIT   ACCOUNT
```

Named per provider rather than abstracted to "root / group / unit". Whoever
reads one of these rows is usually a support engineer matching it against a
portal, and the portal says "organizational unit". An abstract name would be
accurate and would leave them translating.

**AWS has one grant, recorded in two columns.** `consent_status` and
`rbac_verified_at` exist because Azure's two grants fail independently — admin
consent for Graph, and the ARM role — and a customer very often completes the
first and forgets the second. AWS has one cross-account role, and one successful
`sts:AssumeRole` proves everything there is to prove, so that single call sets
both. The alternative was leaving `consent_status` permanently PENDING for a
working connection, which would make `is_verified` false for a connection that
verifies. Its docstring no longer says "both grants": that was true while Azure
was the only provider, and is exactly the kind of sentence that stops being true
without anyone noticing.

## 71. Onboarding moves behind the seam, and the seam has no exceptions left

Scanning was provider-neutral from v0.1 and onboarding never was.
`services/cloud_connections.py` imported Azure's token provider, its ARM and
Graph clients and its role definitions at six call sites, and
`tests/unit/test_provider_seam.py` listed it as `SCHEDULED_EXCEPTIONS` — a leak
by schedule rather than by accident, because `MULTI_CLOUD.md` §8 step 5 put the
split after a second connector and gave the reason: a refactor whose right shape
is knowable from two examples and guessable from one.

AWS is the second example. `ProviderOnboarding`
(`app/connectors/onboarding.py`) is what the two turned out to have in common,
and it is a shape rather than a set of operations:

1. the customer names a scope and a connection is created;
2. CloudGuard hands them something to deploy, **generated from the declared
   permission set** rather than hand-maintained;
3. CloudGuard proves the grant by *using* it, never by being told it exists;
4. the accounts beneath the scope are discovered rather than typed in.

What differs is how many grants there are. Azure has two that fail
independently — Entra admin consent for Graph, and an ARM role — with a service
principal to resolve between them. AWS has one cross-account role and nothing to
consent to.

**The steps a provider does not have return "nothing to do" rather than being
special-cased by the caller.** `start_url` answers `(None, None)`,
`ensure_principal` answers `ready=True`, `grant_problem` answers `None`. This is
the load-bearing part: a caller that branched on provider would be the thing
this split exists to remove, and a connection with no consent step must not sit
forever waiting for one.

### What stayed neutral

The service kept everything that is the same in every cloud and is most of its
length: creating and listing connections, the polling loop and its patience
window, writing discovered accounts and disabling the ones that vanished, the
scan schedule, the change-event debounce, the scope choices, the audit entries.
`_auto_discover` is the clearest split — the provider answers *what exists*, and
the neutral half decides what that means for rows already held.

### Two things this changed on purpose

**`CloudConnection.scope_path` is not a model property any more.** It rendered
an ARM management-group path for whatever it was handed, so an AWS connection
would have carried a plausible-looking Azure scope on every API response — a
wrong answer that reads as a right one. It is `ProviderOnboarding.scope_path`
now, reached through `cloud_connections.scope_path`.

**An unimplemented provider raises rather than answering "current".**
`role_upgrade_available` used to return False for any cloud that was not Azure.
That was correct while the question was "is the Azure role behind" and stopped
being correct the moment the question was routed by provider: False would say a
grant nobody has written is up to date. `get_onboarding` refuses, exactly as
`get_connector_class` does.

### The names

`role_version` stayed as a column and stopped being the word in code.
`grant_version`, `grant_upgrade_available`, `refresh_grant_version`,
`render_artifact`, `deployment_url` — the same mechanism, named for what every
cloud has rather than for what Azure calls it. The column keeps its name because
renaming it is a migration that buys nothing; the code does not, because the
code is what a reader uses to decide whether a concept is Azure-only.

One implementation detail is load-bearing and easy to undo by tidying:
`azure/onboarding.py` imports `app.connectors.azure.auth` as a **module** and
calls `auth.TokenProvider(...)`, rather than importing the name. The service it
came from imported inside each function, which read as an accident and was not:
every test of this path replaces `TokenProvider` with one that issues a prepared
token, and a name bound at import time would not see it.

`SCHEDULED_EXCEPTIONS` is now empty rather than deleted, so the next exception
has to be written down beside a reason instead of quietly appearing in the
allow-list above it.

## 72. The AWS connector, and an SDK where Azure has none

`MULTI_CLOUD.md` §8 step 2 is built: `app/connectors/aws/` sits behind the same
`CloudConnector` contract Azure does, and nothing above the seam changed to
accommodate it except the region dimension, which landed in the collection
executor (§69) rather than in the connector.

### aiobotocore, and why that is not a reversal

`DECISIONS.md` has said "REST over Azure SDKs" since v0.1, and the reason was
never a preference for HTTP: it was that the raw JSON had to be stored verbatim
so a scan could be re-evaluated later against better rules. Azure makes that
easy — ARM is one uniform paginated shape over one auth scheme.

AWS is not one shape. EC2 and IAM speak a query protocol answering XML, S3
speaks REST-XML, and everything else speaks JSON — three parsers, three
pagination idioms, and SigV4 underneath all of them. Hand-rolling that is a
large body of code whose failure mode is a subtly wrong canonical request, and
the property it would buy is one `aiobotocore` already gives: what it returns is
the provider's own response, parsed, and that is what the snapshot stores.

So the principle is unchanged and the implementation differs: **store what the
provider said, whatever it takes to obtain it.**

Two properties are kept from the Azure client because they are not the SDK's job
and the scan depends on them. Pagination is capped, and stopping at the cap is
recorded as PARTIAL rather than returning a shorter list — a list missing an
unknown number of entries cannot support "none of them are public". And a
refusal carries the operation that raised it, so `AccessDenied` on one listing
costs one evidence key.

`ResponseMetadata` is stripped from every response. It is a fact about the HTTP
round trip, changes on every call, and would make two identical readings hash
differently — defeating the evidence store's whole reason for being content
addressed.

### The plan's shape is a function of a call

This is the part with no Azure precedent. `ec2:DescribeRegions` is read *before*
the plan exists, because the plan emits one task per (listing × region) and
cannot be written without the answer.

The case that needed care is when that read fails. A key with **no reading at
all** raises no gap — so a rule sees no error, evaluates against an empty
payload, and returns PASS over an estate nobody looked at. That is the worst
outcome this product can produce. So when the region listing fails, the plan
still emits one task per regional key, region-less, each depending on the region
listing; the executor records them SKIPPED, the gap reaches the rules, and every
regional check reports UNKNOWN. `test_aws_plan.py` pins it, and the reason is
written there so the tasks are not removed as redundant.

An account reporting *zero* enabled regions is treated the same way: an empty
region list is a failure to answer, not an answer.

### One grant, and where it is kept

Azure has two grants that fail independently; AWS has one cross-account role.
The role ARN and its **external id** live in `provider_ref` on the account row,
and every connector now takes `provider_ref` in its constructor — Azure accepts
it and ignores it, which is what lets the pipeline build a connector for any
provider without branching on which.

Per *account* rather than per connection, because an organization-wide
connection assumes one role in each member account. The same stack is deployed
everywhere, so the ARNs differ only by account id and discovery can write them
without asking.

The external id is generated server-side, never accepted from a request body,
and `RoleAssumer` refuses to assume a role without one. An assume-role call with
no external id succeeds against a role whose trust policy does not require one,
which is exactly the misconfiguration CloudGuard must not participate in.

### What the policy grants, and how much of it is ours

`aws/iam.py` mirrors `azure/rbac.py`, with one difference that changes what a
mistake costs. ARM validates a role definition atomically, so a single wrong
action string fails the whole deployment and the customer sees "Deployment
Failed". **IAM accepts a policy naming an action that does not exist** and simply
grants nothing — the deployment succeeds, the customer sees green, and the read
fails mid-scan with `AccessDenied`. That is worse, not better.

So the bulk comes from AWS's own `SecurityAudit` and `ViewOnlyAccess` managed
policies, which cannot contain a typo of ours, and the inline policy holds only
what they do not. Every action in it is a read: no `s3:GetObject`, no
`kms:Decrypt`, no `secretsmanager:GetSecretValue`. CloudGuard can tell a
customer their bucket is public without being able to read a byte out of it, and
that claim is checkable from one tuple.

`iam:GenerateCredentialReport` is the one action that reads as a write and is
not. It creates nothing and changes no configuration; it asks IAM to compile a
report about state that already exists, and without it every credential-age
check reports UNKNOWN.

### Nothing here has been run against AWS

Every action string, response key and pagination shape comes from the published
reference. The modules say so in their docstrings, the action list carries
`# UNVERIFIED`, and `docs/AWS_INTEGRATION.md` §1 holds the checklist that turns
it from plausible into verified. Until that has been run, AWS is reachable
through the API and is not offered in the UI.

## 73. Onboarding AWS: one grant, three steps, and an id generated once

`ProviderOnboarding` (§71) was written against two clouds; this is the second
one filled in. The shape held — name a scope, deploy something generated from
the declared permission set, prove the grant by using it, discover what is
beneath — and every difference falls out of AWS having one grant where Azure has
two.

**No consent step, so nothing waits for one.** The polling loop refused to probe
until consent had reported the trust boundary, which is right for Azure and
would have left every AWS connection permanently PENDING. `has_separate_consent`
is the flag, and the point of it is that the caller does not branch on provider:
a cloud without a consent step says so, and the loop probes immediately because
the stack *is* the grant.

**One probe sets both columns.** A successful `sts:AssumeRole` proves everything
there is to prove, so it writes `consent_status`, `consented_at` and
`rbac_verified_at` together. The organization id arrives from
`organizations:DescribeOrganization` on the same probe rather than from a
callback that does not exist — still from the provider, never typed, which is
the guarantee the Entra callback gives reached by a different route. An account
outside an organization answers with an error, and that is not a failure: a
standalone account is a boundary of one and names itself.

**Every scope names an account, including the widest.** Azure's tenant root
needs no id because consent reports the tenant; AWS has no call it can make
until it knows an account to assume a role in. That is `requires_scope_id`
rather than a comparison against `root_scope`, because the two clouds disagree
about the answer and only one of them can be the default.

### The external id

Generated in `initial_provider_ref`, before the row is written, and never
accepted from a request body. An id the customer chooses is an id an attacker
can choose.

`RoleAssumer` refuses to assume a role without one. That refusal is not
belt-and-braces: an assume-role call with no external id **succeeds** against a
role whose trust policy does not require one, so the only way to be sure
CloudGuard is not participating in that misconfiguration is to make the call
impossible to write.

It is shared across every account under one connection, and correctly — it
identifies the relationship, not the account. The role ARNs differ only by
account id, because the same stack is deployed into each, so discovery writes
them rather than collecting them.

### Reading the deployed version

From the role's inline policy document, not from the stack's version tag. A tag
is a label and a label is not evidence — the same reason the Azure equivalent
resolves role definitions rather than trusting a name, and it gets the answer
right for the customer who attached a broader policy of their own instead of
deploying the stack.

### The gate

AWS is registered in both registries and reachable through the API. It is **not
offered in the UI** until `AWS_INTEGRATION.md` §1's ten-item checklist has been
run against a live account. Shipping the picker first would be the failure
`MULTI_CLOUD.md` §8 named: a large body of code claiming to scan a cloud nobody
had scanned, with the seam looking finished.

## 74. Thirteen AWS rules, and the two things they made the normalizer do

`MULTI_CLOUD.md` §6 said rules stay provider-specific over neutral resource
types, and the reason was never aesthetic: `remediation` is snapshot-copied onto
every finding, and `aws s3api put-public-access-block` is not a variant of
`az storage account update`. A shared rule would have to branch on provider to
produce the fix, which is the same mistake as branching on framework name.

Thirteen rules under `app/rules/aws/` — public bucket, bucket without default
encryption, SSH / RDP / database ports open to the world, RDS publicly
accessible, RDS unencrypted, IAM user without MFA, root access key, stale access
key, weak password policy, a region with no CloudTrail, EBS default encryption
off. Every one declares `provider = Provider.AWS`, so `matches` keeps it away
from an Azure storage account, and the engine narrows the context per provider
so the aggregate rules — which never call `matches` — cannot reach one either.

### The normalizer grew a rule-facing surface

The first draft had rules reading AWS's own payload keys —
`resource.get("PublicAccessBlock.PublicAccessBlockConfiguration")`. That worked
and was wrong in two ways at once. It is not what the Azure normalizer does
(rules there read `allow_blob_public_access`, not an ARM sub-document), and it
made `RemediationSpec` undeclarable: an expected state names *the field the rule
reads*, and a nested path is not a field a test can set.

So the normalizer emits flat fields beside the verbatim payload:
`public_access_blocked`, `policy_is_public`, `default_encryption_enabled`,
`open_ingress`, `publicly_accessible`, `storage_encrypted`, `mfa_active`,
`password_enabled`, `key_idle_days`. The raw shape stays for whoever reads the
capture back.

`open_ingress` earns its place three times over: five rules ask the same
question of the same nested structure, and a fifth copy of that parser is a
fifth chance to read `-1` as "no ports" rather than "all ports".

**`None` is load-bearing in every one of them.** It means the setting was not in
this capture, which is not "off" — and the rules turn it into UNKNOWN rather
than a PASS nobody earned.

### Ages come from the capture, never the clock

`key_idle_days` is computed by the normalizer against `snapshot.collected_at`,
the way Azure computes `days_since_sign_in`. A rule that read `now()` would
answer differently on replay, which would quietly make "verified fixed" a
statement about when somebody asked rather than about the environment.

IAM writes `N/A` for a key nobody has ever used. That falls back to the creation
date rather than being dropped: a key nobody has ever used is the strongest case
for removing it, not a missing value.

### Four rules declare no expected state, and say why

`RemediationSpec` on AWS carries `expected` and `cli` and no `arm_alias`, so
`enforceable` correctly answers False — Azure Policy cannot enforce an S3
setting. The AWS equivalents are an AWS Config rule or an SCP, and neither is
generated, because an unverified one would deploy and check nothing.

Four rules declare `expected=()` outright: the root access key, the password
policy, CloudTrail coverage and EBS defaults. Each is a statement about the
*account* or about a set of regions rather than about an asset, so there is no
resource an expected state could be checked against. That is the existing escape
hatch and it comes with the existing price — an empty declaration owes a reason
and something a customer can still run, and a test enforces both.

The stale-key rule joins them for a different reason worth keeping distinct: its
expectation is a *threshold over a collection* ("no active key unused for ninety
days"), which the three comparisons cannot express. Half-declaring it would let
a customer satisfy what they were shown and still have the finding open.

### Compliance is scoped by the clouds in use

CIS AWS Foundations 3.0 joins the catalogue as data, and `Framework` gains a
`provider`. An AWS-only tenant measured against CIS Azure would report near-zero
coverage for reasons that have nothing to do with its security posture — the
same class of misleading number the coverage ledger exists to prevent, pointed
the other way (`MULTI_CLOUD.md` §7).

Frameworks written about *organizations* — ISO, GDPR, NIST, SOC 2, PCI — carry
no provider and are always shown. An organization with no connections yet sees
everything: there is nothing to scope by, and answering "what does this product
check?" with silence would be worse than showing a benchmark they may not need.

Scoped on *any* connection rather than a verified one, so the AWS benchmark
appears while a customer is still setting AWS up. A framework at 0% because
nothing has been scanned yet is an honest zero.

### The guards that had to become provider-aware

Two existing tests were checking every rule against Azure's answer.
`test_every_rule_depends_on_evidence_something_collects` now looks up the
producing plan per provider, and a new sibling asserts a rule declares its *own*
provider's evidence — a key from the wrong cloud degrades on something that
never runs, and would never appear in that scan's gaps either.

## 75. The wizard learns there are two clouds, and one of them is not offered yet

The setup flow was written for Azure and read as Azure everywhere: four rail
rows, a consent step, "Deploy to Azure", "subscriptions". Most of it generalized
by naming things differently; three parts did not, and those are the ones worth
recording.

**The rail is a function of the provider, not a constant.** AWS has three steps
where Azure has four, because there is nothing to consent to. A rail with a
permanently grey "Grant consent" row would read as a flow stuck on something
nobody is going to do — so `setupSteps(provider)` returns the rows and
`connectionStage` never returns `"consent"` for a cloud without one.

**The external id is on the deploy panel, before the customer deploys.** They
are about to create a trust policy that requires it, and the single thing making
this integration safe is that the policy demands a value only they and
CloudGuard know. Somebody who cannot see it cannot check that the stack they ran
actually asks for it. It is shown as copyable text with a sentence saying it is
not a password: on its own it grants nothing, and it is useless to anyone
without a role that demands it.

**The access panel states one grant or two, from the provider.** A permanently
green "Consent: granted" row beside a single AWS grant would be describing a
step that never happened.

### The copy is an override, not a second copy

`t.setup.aws` holds the dozen sentences that differ and nothing else;
`setupCopy(t, provider)` spreads it over the shared block. Two full sets would
drift, and the half that drifted would be the half nobody was looking at.

The types needed one accommodation: `en.ts` is a const object, so every value
has a literal type and an intersection of `"Connect Azure"` and `"Connect AWS"`
is `never`. `AsStrings<T>` widens, which is what lets one component read a
sentence whose wording depends on the cloud.

### AWS is in the picker and cannot be chosen

`GET /cloud-connections/providers` answers what this deployment can connect,
and the wizard renders unavailable options **greyed out with the reason** rather
than hiding them. A picker that silently held an option back answers "does this
support AWS?" with nothing; one that shows it disabled with a sentence answers
it, and tells an operator what to do about it.

Two reasons it can be unavailable, and they are different in kind. No AWS
identity configured is an ordinary deployment gap. `AWS_ENABLED=false` — the
default — is the honest one: every IAM action name, response shape and template
string in the connector was written from AWS's published reference and has been
called by nothing. `docs/AWS_INTEGRATION.md` §1 holds the ten-item checklist,
and until it has been run against a real account, offering AWS would be a
product claiming to scan a cloud nobody has scanned.

That gate is deliberately separate from having credentials, because the two
failures need different people. One is an environment variable; the other is an
afternoon with a real AWS account.

### What reaches the browser

`provider_ref` is filtered through an allow-list on the way out, not passed
through. That column is where a provider-shaped field lands, and the next one
added should have to be named before a customer can see it. Both current
entries are things the customer needs in front of them — the role ARN to check
what they deployed, the external id to check their own trust policy requires
it — and neither is a credential.

## 76. Change-triggered scanning on AWS, and the handshake that fetches

Change events were deliberately out of the first AWS slice (§72). They are in
now, and one difference from Azure turned out to have a security consequence
rather than a cosmetic one.

**The path is EventBridge → SNS → HTTPS.** EventBridge cannot post to an
arbitrary HTTPS endpoint on its own; doing it directly needs an API destination,
which needs the customer to create a connection holding a credential, then a
destination, then a rule — three resources and a secret of ours in their
account. An SNS topic with an HTTPS subscription is one more command than Azure
needs and stores nothing of ours. The topic is theirs, in their account, and
CloudGuard holds no permission over it — the same trade as the Event Grid
subscription: CloudGuard generates the commands and the customer runs them,
because creating any of it is a *write*.

### The handshake is an SSRF if you let it be

Event Grid confirms a subscription by asking for a code echoed in the response
body. **SNS confirms by handing over a URL and activating when it is fetched.**
That is an outbound request triggered by an inbound payload, from an endpoint
anybody holding the connection's token can reach — so the host is not taken on
trust. `confirmation_url` returns the URL only when it matches
`sns.<region>.amazonaws.com` (or `.com.cn`), and `None` for everything else;
`None` is refused rather than fetched.

The check lives in the *feed*, not in the endpoint, because the cloud that knows
what its own hosts look like is the one that should be saying. `test_aws_change_events.py`
pins the four ways this gets written wrongly: a suffix test passes
`…amazonaws.com.evil.test`, a substring test passes `evil.test/sns.…amazonaws.com`,
and anything splitting on the wrong character passes
`https://sns.…amazonaws.com@evil.test/`.

The contract gained `confirmation_url` for this. Azure answers `None` — it
echoes instead — so the endpoint serves both without learning which cloud does
which.

### One route, and the URL customers already have

`/events/azure/{id}` became `/events/{provider}/{id}`. The provider is a path
segment rather than a lookup, which means every Event Grid subscription already
wired to the old URL keeps working unchanged — the literal `azure` still
matches. An unknown provider, or one with no feed, is a 404 rather than a
dropped event: that is not a delivery CloudGuard decided against, it is a URL
nothing should be posting to.

### What is filtered, and where

Both feeds filter twice, and for the same reason. The endpoint drops what it
cannot use anyway; a filter the *provider* applies is traffic that never leaves
the customer's account. AWS's rule pattern names the nine event sources rules
actually read, and the endpoint additionally drops reads (`Get`, `List`,
`Describe`…) and failed calls — a scan started because somebody listed their
buckets is a scan nothing asked for, and a call that failed left the environment
as it was.

A malformed `Message` is dropped rather than raised. The endpoint answers 200 to
everything it decides not to act on, and an exception would turn that into hours
of SNS redelivering the same unparseable payload.

## 77. Nothing is collected and unjudged, and the graph edge that stopped short

The first AWS slice left eleven evidence keys collected and read by no rule, and
nineteen of thirty-one CIS AWS controls with nothing behind them. Both are now
closed as far as they honestly can be: **thirty AWS rules, no key collected and
unjudged unless it is declared baseline, and 28 of 31 controls covered.**

The three that remain are named rather than quietly absent. 1.17 (a support role
exists) was called organizational here and marked `technically_assessable=False`
— **that was wrong, and §81 corrects it**. 4.1 and 4.3
are CloudWatch metric filters with alarms attached, which needs a collection this
connector does not have and a match against CIS's exact filter patterns — a
check that got the pattern slightly wrong would report a control satisfied that
is not, which is worse than reporting it uncovered.

### The distinction that decides whether an unjudged key is a bug

`BASELINE_EVIDENCE` is the answer, and it is not a loophole. VPCs, subnets,
network interfaces, elastic IPs, IAM roles, instance profiles and the account
list are collected because the *product* is built from them — the inventory, the
graph — not because a rule judges them. Everything else that was unjudged now
has a rule, and `test_aws_evidence.py` holds the line: every key is produced by
something, and the ones no rule reads are declared.

### The graph edge that stopped one hop short

An EC2 instance names its **instance profile**; the profile names the **role**.
The first pass drew `HAS_IDENTITY` to the profile ARN, which is not a resource
CloudGuard holds — so the hop from a compromised workload to everything it may
do ended nowhere. `iam:ListInstanceProfiles` is collected for exactly this, and
the edge is resolved through it.

Deriving the role ARN from the profile's name would have worked most of the
time, which is the worst available property: the graph would have claimed a path
to a role that does not exist. An unresolvable profile draws no edge.

### Two collection calls that read like writes and are not

`iam:GenerateCredentialReport` was the first (§72). `config:DescribeConfigurationRecorderStatus`
is folded into the recorder task rather than given its own key — unusually for
this connector, which normally splits anything separately deniable. It is not
separately deniable here: both calls come from the same managed policy and are
refused together, and **a recorder that exists and is stopped is the finding**,
which needs both halves to see. Creating a recorder is two commands; starting it
is the third, and it is the one people miss.

### Where a naive check gets the wrong answer

Four cases were worth the tests they carry.

* **A network ACL's default entry is a deny-all on `0.0.0.0/0`.** Read without
  checking `RuleAction`, every correctly-written ACL in AWS reports as open.
  Egress entries are not ingress, either.
* **A multi-region CloudTrail trail is returned by every region it covers.**
  That is what makes coverage answerable (AWS-LOG-001) and what would make every
  other trail rule count one trail seventeen times. `_unique_trails` keys by ARN.
* **IAM accepts `*` and `*:*` and means the same thing.** A check that knew one
  spelling would pass the other. A statement carrying a `Condition` is not the
  unbounded grant this rule is about.
* **A flow log or an analyzer in a non-ACTIVE state records nothing.** Reading
  existence rather than status would pass an account logging nothing.

And one where the honest answer is UNKNOWN: the CloudTrail bucket is very often
in a *different* account — a dedicated log archive is the shape AWS recommends —
and CloudGuard cannot read a bucket it was not granted. "We could not look" is
not "logging is off".

### Two rules that decline rather than raise

An AWS-managed KMS key rotates on AWS's schedule and the setting cannot be
changed, so AWS-SEC-001 returns NOT_APPLICABLE for one rather than a finding
nobody can close. AWS-LOG-002 does the same when the account has no trail at all:
that is AWS-LOG-001's finding, and raising both would charge the security score
twice for one problem written two ways.

### The policy goes to v2

Eleven new actions, so every existing connection reports "redeploy the stack"
until they do — the prompt is honest, the checks that need the new actions report
UNKNOWN meanwhile, and no other category is affected. `V1_ACTIONS` is written out
rather than sliced off v2: what an older stack grants is a fact about that stack,
and deriving it from today's list would make it change every time today's list
does.

## 78. The columns say "subscription" and the sentences do not

`DECISIONS.md` §70 kept `tenant_id` and `subscription_id` under Azure's names,
because `RawSnapshot.to_json` writes them into every stored capture and renaming
them would make each one unreplayable. That decision was about *identifiers*, and
it quietly became a decision about *sentences* too — which it was never meant to
be.

The result was a product that told an AWS customer "this subscription is no
longer connected to CloudGuard", showed "3 of 5 subscriptions" against their
organization, and offered a button reading **Connect Azure** on the page where
they were about to connect AWS. Each is small. Together they are a CSPM that has
not noticed which cloud it is looking at, which is not a small thing for a
product whose whole claim is that it looked.

So the split is now explicit: **identifiers stay Azure-flavoured, sentences do
not.** `app/core/vocabulary.py` and `src/lib/vocabulary.ts` are the two places
that know the difference.

### Nouns, not sentences

Both hold `account` / `accounts` / `boundary` / `directory` / `artifact` /
`console` and nothing longer. A sentence per provider would be two sentences to
keep in step, and the half nobody was looking at would drift — the same reason
`t.setup.aws` is an override rather than a second copy of the setup block.

An unknown provider gets Azure's words rather than an exception. This is a
sentence, not a security decision: a missing noun should read slightly wrong
rather than break the page somebody is trying to read.

### Where it is applied, and where it is not

Applied to what a **customer** reads: the scanner's scope and collection errors,
`ScanStep.describe`, the scan's problem list (which becomes `error_message`), the
stalled-deployment message, the finding route's directory error, the connection
row, the account scope list, the scan detail panel.

Not applied to the log lines. `_log_step` keeps the neutral default, because a
log line is read by us and threading a provider through it would cost a query per
step to change a word nobody outside is reading.

Not applied to `t.setup`, either: that block is Azure's, and AWS overrides it
whole. Two of its strings still say "subscription" and are correct — they are the
Azure branch.

`DEPLOY_STALLED_DETAIL` stopped being a constant and became
`deploy_stalled_detail(connection)`. It names both the artefact and the console,
and it is shown at the moment a customer is most likely to be confused about
which step they are on — "the scanner role … in Azure Portal" is the wrong pair
of nouns for somebody who ran a CloudFormation stack.

### The scan scope now says which cloud it read

`ScanScope` gained `provider`. The field names around it keep Azure's vocabulary
because the columns do; this is the one field that lets the panel reading them
choose the right label rather than guess from the shape of an id.

### What is deliberately unchanged

Every API field name and every database column. `subscriptions`,
`subscription_id`, `subscription_count`, `tenant_id`. Renaming them is a
migration of stored captures plus a breaking change to the frontend, buys no
customer anything, and is the work §70 already argued should happen on its own
rather than inside the change that adds a second provider.

## 79. A recorded AWS estate, because there is no other way to watch it work

The demo seed replayed a recorded Azure snapshot through the real pipeline so
the product loop could be shown before anyone had a tenant. AWS needs that more,
not less: nothing in `app/connectors/aws/` has been run against a live account,
so a recording is the **only** way to see the second half of the product work end
to end.

`--provider aws` seeds an organization from
`tests/fixtures/aws_raw/snapshot_mixed.json`. The recording is in the shape the
collector produces — regional blocks, per-bucket readings keyed by name, the
credential report as parsed rows — and everything after it is real: the real
normalizer, thirty real rules, the real risk engine, the real findings
lifecycle.

**What it proves and what it does not** is worth being exact about. It proves
the regional blocks unwrap, the per-bucket readings join, the graph resolves its
capability hop through the instance profile, thirty rules reach a verdict, and
none of them reports UNKNOWN over evidence that arrived. It proves nothing about
whether the payloads it replays are the payloads AWS actually sends — which is
exactly what `AWS_INTEGRATION.md` §1 covers, and why the checklist still gates
the UI.

### The fixture is a test before it is a demo

`test_aws_demo_environment.py` pins the verdicts as a **set**, not a count: a
count tells you something changed, the set tells you what. It also asserts no
Azure rule touches the recording, and that the capture round-trips through
`to_json`/`from_json` to the same conclusions — if those disagreed about the
regional block shape, every replayed AWS scan would quietly reach different
verdicts from the scan that took the reading.

Sharing the fixture between the demo and the tests is deliberate in both
directions. A demo assembled from fabricated findings would prove nothing about
the code that produces them, and a fixture nobody looks at drifts from the
product it is supposed to describe.

### The estate is deliberately not catastrophic

The first draft failed 28 of 30 rules. That is a worse demonstration, not a
better one: the security score floors at zero (`RISK_ENGINE.md` §3, and the open
item already recorded), and a screen with no green on it says nothing about a
product whose whole point is telling the two apart.

Tuned to 14 failures against 21 passes, and the split is the realistic one — the
account-wide controls are in place, and what is wrong is wrong about particular
resources. That is what a competent team's estate looks like.

### `--fix` closes two, and the bucket needed both halves

The repaired replay closes the public bucket and the open SSH rule. The bucket
fix sets **both** the access block and the policy status, because the rule
refuses a bucket that blocks public ACLs and still carries a policy granting
`*` — two independent ways in. A fix satisfying half of it would leave the
finding open and make the demo look broken while the product was working
correctly, which is the kind of thing that gets a correct check deleted.

`ReplayConnector` takes its provider from the recording rather than from the
class, and asks the right connector's `keys_in` when turning a recorded category
error into per-key gaps. Getting that second one wrong would show a degraded
banner over rules that passed regardless — the contradiction the coverage ledger
exists to prevent.

## 80. CIS section 4, and the chain a setting cannot express

4.1 and 4.3 were left uncovered in §77 with a stated reason: they need a
collection the connector did not have, *and* a match against CIS's exact filter
patterns, and a check that got the pattern slightly wrong would report a control
satisfied that is not. Both halves are now addressed, and the second one is
addressed by not pretending.

### The question is a chain, not a setting

"Is anybody told when this happens" has six hops:

```
trail → CloudWatch log group → metric filter → metric → alarm → alarm action
```

Every one of them can be missing on its own, and a missing hop anywhere means
nobody is told. This is why the check is worth writing carefully rather than at
all: **the most common state is half-done** — the filter exists, the metric is
published, and no alarm was ever created on it. A rule that looked only for the
filter would pass exactly that account, which is worse than not having the rule,
because it would be a confident wrong answer about whether anyone is watching.

So `MonitoringCheck` carries *where* the chain stops rather than a boolean.
"No filter" and "a filter with no alarm" are the same verdict and different
afternoons, and the message says which.

Two hops needed care beyond existence. An **alarm with no action** changes a
colour on a dashboard nobody is looking at, so it is counted as silent rather
than as an alarm. And an alarm can only watch a metric in its **own region**, so
the metric key includes the region — a filter in eu-west-1 and an alarm in
us-east-1 are two things that never meet, and pairing them would report a chain
that does not exist.

### The pattern match is necessary and not sufficient, and says so

CIS specifies exact filter patterns. Requiring the literal string would fail
every team that wrote an equivalent one; evaluating CloudWatch's filter-pattern
language properly means implementing somebody else's expression grammar, and
implementing it *nearly* right is worse than not implementing it — a pattern that
parses differently to how AWS parses it produces a confident wrong answer, which
is the failure this codebase refuses everywhere.

So the test is that the pattern names every ingredient the event is about:
`$.errorCode` plus both refusal codes for 4.1, `$.userIdentity.type` plus `Root`
for 4.3. Each ingredient is a set of alternatives, which is what lets
`AccessDenied` and `AccessDenied*` both count without accepting a pattern
mentioning neither.

**And the matched pattern goes into the finding's evidence, verbatim.** That is
the part that makes the compromise honest rather than merely convenient: a
reader is shown what was matched and can judge it, instead of being asked to
trust this rule's opinion of a language it does not parse. The `notes` on the
remediation declaration say the same thing to the customer.

### Two rules rather than one

They walk the same chain and are not the same check: a pattern matching refused
API calls says nothing about root usage. `_MonitoredEventRule` holds the walk;
each rule declares its ingredients and its sentence.

Both return NOT_APPLICABLE when the account has no trail at all. That is
AWS-LOG-001's finding, and raising all three would charge the security score
three times for one problem written three ways — the same reasoning AWS-LOG-002
already followed.

### Where this leaves the benchmark

**30 of 31 CIS AWS controls covered** at the time this was written. The one
remaining was 1.17, "a support role exists to manage incidents with AWS Support",
described here as organizational — **§81 corrects that, and corrects the
catalogue it was counted against**.

The policy goes to **v3** for `logs:DescribeMetricFilters` and
`cloudwatch:DescribeAlarms`. Both are very likely already inside `SecurityAudit`,
which carries `logs:Describe*` and `cloudwatch:Describe*`; they are granted
anyway, in the direction `rbac.py` already prefers — a redundant read action
costs a redeploy prompt, and a missing one costs two checks whose cause is one
denied call several minutes into a scan.

## 81. 1.17 was not organizational, and the catalogue was flattering itself

Two corrections, and the second is the one that mattered.

### The control

§77 and §80 said CIS AWS 1.17 — "a support role exists to manage incidents with
AWS Support" — was organizational and marked `technically_assessable=False`. That
was an assumption from the control's wording, and it was wrong. **CIS's own audit
procedure for it is a single API call:**

```
aws iam list-entities-for-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSSupportAccess
```

The policy ARN is AWS's own and identical in every account, which is what makes
this one call rather than a walk over every principal's attachments. AWS-IAM-009
asks exactly that question, and the flag on the catalogue entry is now gone.

It is the first rule with `exploitability = 0`, and that is precise rather than
lazy: there is no attack here at all. The cost is paid *during* an incident
rather than caused by one — an account under active abuse needs a case opened
with AWS, and without this policy attached to somebody the only way in is root,
which is slow, usually held by one person, and exactly the credential an incident
response should not be reaching for. It scores as nothing and is reported anyway,
because a product that only reported what scores would never mention it.

### The catalogue

Covering 1.17 took CIS AWS to 31 of 31, and
`test_catalogue_lists_controls_no_rule_covers` failed — correctly. Its reason is
in its own name: *"a catalogue of only what CloudGuard checks would report full
coverage forever."*

The catalogue was not complete; it was **the controls I had written rules for,
plus the handful I had written down as gaps.** Full coverage of that is not a
number worth printing, and the guard is what stopped it being printed.

So the catalogue grew to the shape it should have had: the whole of section 4
rather than the three controls referenced, the section 1 controls a scanner
genuinely cannot reach (contact details, security questions), and the section 2
and 5 entries this product does not check. **31 of 56**, and every one of the
twenty-five gaps is a real control somebody could ask about.

Thirteen of those gaps are section-4 metric filters, all the same shape as the
two now covered (§80). That makes them a backlog item rather than a limitation,
and the catalogue says so — which is a more useful thing for a customer to read
than a coverage bar at 100%.

**The lesson is the guard's, not mine.** A test asserting that every framework
has an uncovered control looks like an odd thing to write until the day a
catalogue quietly becomes a list of answers rather than a list of questions.

## 82. The other thirteen of section 4, written as declarations

§81 left thirteen CIS AWS controls uncovered and called them a backlog item
rather than a limitation, on the grounds that the two covered ones prove the
shape is reachable. This is that backlog item, closed. CIS AWS is now 44 of the
56 catalogued controls, and every one of section 4 is walked.

### Thirteen rules and no new evaluation

The chain was already written: trail → CloudWatch log group → metric filter →
metric → alarm → action, in `_MonitoredEventRule`. Each of the thirteen declares
what CIS's own filter pattern for that control names — `$.eventName` and
`StopLogging` for a trail being silenced, `kms.amazonaws.com` with both
`DisableKey` and `ScheduleKeyDeletion` for a key being destroyed — and nothing
else. No new collector, no new evidence key, no new walk.

The check stays what §80 made it: a **necessary condition**. CloudGuard does not
evaluate CloudWatch's filter-pattern language, because implementing somebody
else's expression grammar *nearly* right produces a confident wrong answer. The
pattern that matched travels in the finding, so a reader judges it rather than
trusting this product's opinion of it.

### The remediation is generated, and that is the point

Thirteen copies of one paragraph drift. The day the alarm command gains an
argument, twelve of them keep the old one and a customer follows whichever they
were handed. So the prose and the `RemediationSpec` are both built from one
filter-name-and-pattern pair per rule, by `_monitoring_remediation` and
`_monitoring_spec` — the same reasoning as the IAM manifest being generated from
the declared permission set rather than hand-maintained (§72).

`test_the_filter_the_remediation_prints_satisfies_the_check` closes the loop:
for every rule in this family, the pattern printed in the remediation satisfies
that rule's own check. It is the discipline `test_remediation_spec.py` applies to
rules that can state an expected value, applied to the ones that cannot — a
customer who runs exactly what the finding told them to run passes.

The second test is the one that earns its place over time.
`test_no_rule_here_is_satisfied_by_another_one_s_filter` runs the full matrix:
fifteen patterns against fifteen rules, and only the diagonal passes. Fifteen
rules sharing one evaluation is a saving right up until two of them accept the
same filter, at which point an account is told something is watched that nothing
watches. Both tests read the family off `RULE_REGISTRY`, so a sixteenth rule is
covered on the day it is added rather than the day somebody remembers.

### Severities, and the one that is deliberately LOW

Two are HIGH because they are the ones that hide or destroy: a trail being
stopped (4.5) blinds every other alarm in the section, and a customer key being
scheduled for deletion (4.7) is the destructive path that needs no data access at
all. Organizations changes (4.15) are HIGH for a different reason — everything
CloudGuard checks in a member account is checked on the assumption that the
organization above it still constrains that account, and `LeaveOrganization`
ends that assumption without changing anything inside the account.

Console sign-in failures (4.6) are LOW, and stating why is more useful than the
number: a password policy and enforced MFA are preventive, CloudGuard checks
both separately, and this is only detective. It is still reported, because a
spray that eventually succeeds produces a *successful* sign-in nothing else
distinguishes from a Monday morning.

All thirteen keep the family's exploitability of 1. None of them is exploitable;
each weakens detection.

### The recorded estate grew filters rather than findings

The obvious way to land thirteen aggregate rules is to let the recorded estate
(§79) fail all thirteen. That would have been dishonest twice over: an account
that has written no metric filters at all is not the account this recording
describes — it has a trail, a log group and a CIS filter already — and
`test_most_of_the_estate_passes` exists precisely to stop the demo becoming a
wall of red that shows none of the product's ability to tell good from bad.

So the fixture gained eleven filters and their alarms, and deliberately not
thirteen. It has no filter for a key being scheduled for deletion and none for
Organizations, which is what a real account looks like after somebody worked
through a benchmark and stopped at the services they use daily. Two new findings,
eleven new passes.

### What this does not change

Nothing here has been near a live AWS account. These rules read
`log_metric_filters` and `cloudwatch_alarms` as `normalizer.py` produces them,
and whether those payloads are the payloads AWS actually sends is still
`AWS_INTEGRATION.md` §1's question — checks 16 and 17 in particular, which are
about exactly the ARN shape and the `metricTransformations` spelling this family
joins on.

## 83. The dashboard's two list panels are Cards, and the feed is a timeline

Every dashboard panel drew its own chrome — a `<section>` with a hand-written
`rounded-xl bg-card ring-1 ring-foreground/10` and its own header padding —
which is the `Card` primitive's job (§24) copied nine times. `PriorityRisks` and
`RecentChanges` are the first two to move: both now use `Card` / `CardHeader` /
`CardTitle` / `CardDescription` / `CardAction` / `CardContent`, with
`role="region"` carrying the labelling the `<section>` used to, and
`--card-spacing` set to 5 so their padding still lines up with the seven
neighbours that have not moved yet. Those seven are a follow-on, not a
different decision: the two panels here changed because their *content* was
being restyled, and converting the rest is a mechanical edit with no visual
consequence.

### A risk row leads with severity, not with an ordinal

The rank was rendered as a small grey `1 2 3` in its own column. The list is
already in rank order, so the column spent a column restating the reading
direction. It is replaced by a severity-tinted mark that takes its colours from
`levelStyle` — the same map `SeverityBadge` reads, so a row's tile and its badge
can never disagree about what CRITICAL looks like — and its *shape* from what
the row is: a route mark for a scenario, a shield for everything else.

The badge moved to the trailing cluster beside the score, where the eye lands
after the title rather than before it. Nothing was dropped: the score, the
scenario marker, and the exposure/sensitivity/criticality terms that explain the
ranking all still render, the last of these now each with their own icon rather
than three identical radar glyphs.

### The change feed is drawn as the sequence it is

`RecentChanges` was five flat rows with a date pinned to the right edge. It is
now a three-column timeline — date gutter, spine, entry — because the question
it answers is temporal: whether a week's movement was one bad afternoon or a
steady drift is visible in the spacing of the marks and invisible in a right-
aligned column of dates.

The spine stops at the first and last mark rather than running to the edges of
the list, which would imply rows that are not there. The mark keeps both its
colour and its shape (`TrendingUp` for a regression, `Plus` for an arrival,
`Minus` for neutral), so the §66-adjacent honesty rule survives the restyle: an
attribute that moved into UNKNOWN is a loss of knowledge, renders neutral, and
is still distinguishable from an improvement without relying on hue.

## Settings: the evidence a person supplies

`PATCH /organizations` takes no id in the path. Deleting a *different*
organization from the one on screen is a real thing to want and DELETE keeps
its id; editing one is not, so the target comes from the tenant context and the
membership check has already happened.

Two write shapes sit on this screen and they are deliberately opposite. The
organization profile is patched — only the fields sent are written, so saving a
corrected name cannot clear a country nobody touched. A context declaration is
a *statement*, replaced whole, so a reader always knows what it currently
claims without diffing. `UNKNOWN` is refused by the API and absent from the
menus for the same reason: it is CloudGuard's own answer for "nothing said
anything", and a customer declaring it would assert an absence that leaving the
field unset already asserts.

Declarations are not retroactive and the screen says so. A risk score is what a
scan concluded; rewriting stored scores from a form would leave findings
carrying numbers no observation ever produced.

## Open items carried forward

**The security score floors at zero quickly.** The deductions in
`RISK_ENGINE.md` §3 are −20 per Critical-band finding, so five of them reach
zero. The demo environment scores 0/100 before remediation and 52/100 after.
This is the specified formula and it is honest, but it loses resolution at the
bad end: an organization with five Critical findings and one with fifty both
read 0. The spec anticipates tuning these values against real environments;
`app/risk/config.py` is where that happens, and no rule logic needs to change.

**Phase 9 (reports) is built, generated on request rather than stored.**
Jinja2 renders the report to HTML and WeasyPrint prints that HTML — the stack
`ARCHITECTURE.md` §1 already named. Three choices there are worth keeping:

* **No jobs table, no artifact store.** A report is a read of data that is
  already computed, and the technical report is bounded at
  `MAX_TECHNICAL_FINDINGS` so it cannot grow into something that needs a queue.
  Storing PDFs would additionally owe the customer an answer about which of
  five stored copies is current; regenerating is cheap and always truthful.
* **HTML is the artifact, PDF is the wrapper.** `render_html` is what the
  templates produce and what the tests assert against; `render_pdf` prints it.
  This is not only for testing: WeasyPrint needs native pango/cairo/harfbuzz
  that a developer machine may lack, so the import is lazy and a server without
  them answers 503 with one clear sentence instead of failing every import that
  transitively reaches the module.
* **The trend is drawn on a fixed 0–100 scale.** The report is asked whether
  posture is improving, and a sparkline fitted to its own observed range makes
  a wobble from 81 to 84 climb as steeply as a recovery from 20 to 84. Inline
  SVG, generated by a pure function, because a PDF has no JavaScript and
  nothing in a report may fetch anything. Fewer than two readings draws
  nothing: a line through one point shows a direction nobody measured.
* **The caveats are printed, not hovered.** A PDF outlives the screen it was
  taken from and gets forwarded to auditors and boards, so the cover carries
  when the evidence was collected, how many checks reached no verdict, what
  could not be read at all, and that compliance coverage is evidence rather than
  a verdict. UNKNOWN never renders as a pass, on paper as on screen, and an
  accepted risk is counted in its own right rather than absorbed into
  "not open" — it is a decision to live with a finding, not a fix.

**Compliance mappings drive a coverage view, still without framework logic.**
Every rule carries CIS Azure 2.0, ISO 27001, GDPR and NIST CSF control
references in `rules.compliance_mappings`. `app/compliance/catalog.py` supplies
the other half — what those identifiers mean — as data, and
`app/services/compliance.py` joins the two against the latest scan. Requirement
15 still holds: no rule imports the catalogue, and nothing anywhere branches on
a framework name.

Three choices there are worth keeping:

* **Control titles are CloudGuard's own wording.** CIS Benchmarks and ISO/IEC
  27001 are copyrighted under licences restricting redistribution of their text.
  The identifiers are reproduced; the prose is not. Every framework carries a
  link to its authoritative source.
* **The catalogue lists controls no rule covers.** A catalogue of only what
  CloudGuard checks would report full coverage forever. A test asserts each
  framework has at least one uncovered control, and another asserts every
  control a rule references actually exists — a typo in a mapping would
  otherwise produce evidence that silently goes nowhere.
* **Coverage counts conclusions, not passes.** `coverage_ratio` is the share of
  controls CloudGuard reached a verdict on. UNKNOWN resolves to INCONCLUSIVE and
  is excluded — the same reason UNKNOWN is never PASS in the rule engine, except
  that here the misreading would end up in front of an auditor.

**A connection is a tenant or management group; subscriptions are discovered.**
`cloud_accounts` used to *be* the connection — one row per subscription, tenant
id typed in by hand. That had two problems.

The first was a blind spot. A subscription created after onboarding was invisible
to CloudGuard, because nobody had registered it. An environment that is never
scanned produces no findings, and no findings reads as safe. Everywhere else this
product refuses that trade — UNKNOWN is never PASS, gaps are recorded rather than
dropped — and the connection layer quietly violated it.

The second was a tenant-binding hole. `cloud_accounts.tenant_id` came from the
request body, and validation only checked whether Azure answered. But CloudGuard's
service principal exists in *every* tenant that has ever consented, so naming one
of those tenants on a fresh connection and clicking verify succeeded — the probe
passes, because the access is genuinely there — and the caller was reading an
environment belonging to somebody else. This is the confused-deputy problem AWS
integrations use an ExternalId for.

Both are fixed by the same change. `cloud_connections.tenant_id` is nullable and
written in exactly one place: the consent callback, from the tenant Entra itself
reports. Validation refuses any connection whose own consent has not completed.
A per-connection nonce additionally rides in the deployment artifact and is read
back from the role assignment's description — defence in depth, not the primary
control, since it is consent that binds the tenant.

`scope_type` keeps the narrow option first-class: `SUBSCRIPTION` behaves exactly
as the old model did. The coverage-versus-least-privilege trade is the customer's
to make, and a tenant-wide grant is genuinely broader than they may want.

Everything below a cloud account — scans, resources, findings, risk, compliance —
is untouched by this. Discovered subscriptions are still `cloud_accounts` rows,
so the pipeline never learned that anything changed.

**Supabase connections go through the Session pooler, not the direct host.**
Current Supabase projects resolve `db.<ref>.supabase.co` to an IPv6-only
address, and Railway cannot route IPv6 -- the connection fails with `Network is
unreachable` before it leaves the container. The Session pooler
(`aws-0-<region>.pooler.supabase.com`, port 5432) is IPv4 and behaves like a
normal PostgreSQL connection, including the session-level `SET LOCAL ROLE` and
`request.jwt.claims` that RLS depends on. The Transaction pooler on port 6543
is not an option: it does not support prepared statements, which asyncpg
requires.

**Multi-subscription accounts.** `cloud_accounts` holds a single
`subscription_id`, matching `DATABASE.md` §2. The child-table alternative the
spec mentions is a migration away and no core logic assumes one subscription per
tenant.
